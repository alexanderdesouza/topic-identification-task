    "## **LDA Topic Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective in this notebook is to extract topics from the corpus of uk.TrustPilot.uk reviews of train service in the UK. Example tasks include,\n",
    "* Extract the main topics being discussed. (Covered in **Topic Identification** below.)\n",
    "* Analyse how the topics changed over time. Is there a difference in the topics or their frequency over time?\n",
    "* Visualise the results. (See **Visualizations**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This objective was met using Latent Dirchlet Alloction (LDA). LDA can be thought of as \"soft clustering\". If the number of topics in a given corpra is the number of clusters, and the probability of any one corpus belonging to a topic is roughly the proportion of cluster membership, then LDA can be interpreted as a way of clustering the corpra into distinct clusters. Contrasting this with k-means, where each entity can belong to only one cluster, LDA allows for \"fuzzy\" memberships. Thereby providing a more nuanced way of indentifying similar items in the input data.\n",

I've been a regular commuter between Manchester and London for donkey's years and accept that sometimes things go wrong. However, lack of communication is still a major issue as demonstrated yesterday.\",\"Travelling first class 7.08 London Kings Cross to York on Virgin East Coast. Asked for a cook breakfast but told I couldn't have one as getting off at Peterborough (50 mins later) and not enough time to make it. 16 mins after leaving Kings Cross other first class passengers started getting full English. When I asked again I was told I was not eligible as I was travelling less than 70 mins and was given a choice of a stale croissant or cold toast. There were also customers who seemed to know the staff and who got off at Peterborough and were served bacon rolls. Great customer service Virgin - try being flexible with your first class customers. Carriage had the aroma of full English breakfast to add to the torment. I was not even allowed to buy a full English but could have bought a cheese and ham toaster. Customer service response - read the terms and conditions on the menu! Save your money and go second class for short journeys if you are expecting food.\",\"Excellent service and delightful staff.\",\"A shabby service from Brussels to London yesterday.\",\"I bought tickets on line. Went and collected tickets from fast tickets. 5 coupons  to come out. Didn't have the ticket. Not knowing the problem, went for the train and wasn't allowed to board. Came back to the ticket booth and  all of them unanimously said it is well known.\",\"First time I've ever traveled with virgin trains, and not a very pleasant experience. Completely messed up seat reservations, attidtude of staff on board completely appalling, I plan on launching an official complaint but such a low quality company that I expect they'll completely ignore the customer. Next time I'll use a different train company.\",\"Am travelling on 02/08 on the 07.03 from Darlington to London Kings Cross. Train fairly empty. Toilets next to coaches E & D are disgusting. The floor is very wet, toilets blocked. Yuck. Goodness knows what they'll be like later in the day.\",\"Tried to use promotion to get discounted ticket but website link wasn't working.  Web support confirmed validity and told me to book and claim refund.  I went ahead on this basis this but now Virgin refuse to make the refund.\",\"During my journey I observed many  passengers in carriage A (at the back of the train) feeling queasy.\",\"I'm travelling so called first class from Preston to London. What a joke! The seats are hard and uncomfortable. They resemble second class seats in British Rail days but are not as comfortable. No proper breakfast just a bun, watery coffee in a plastic cup and a piece of fruit! WowI I paid \\u00a340 extra for this! My advice is to save money and book standard class in future. Virgin certainly need to buck their ideas up. Some proper competition on this route is badly needed.\",\"Paid over \\u00a3400 for 3 1st class tickets from Peterbourgh to KIngs Cross yesterday.  We were forced to stand in standard class in a corridor next to the toilet, 1st class, I don't think so.\",\"Just made a booking through Virgin trains website and selected my allocated seats, seats we're selected fine but when it came to confirming my order I have been given a totally different seats to ones I've requested, I paid a lot of money for these as their first class and for my partners birthday, after ringing Virgin a number of times and emailing them they said they may be able to change them within 2 working days but cannot guarantee those seats, terrible service!!\",\"Paid for a first class ticket and received none of the benefits as the catering staff had left the train early. Staff were rude and unhelpful. Train was delayed. Do not use, they don't even deserve one star.Will not be travelling with Virgin again.\",\"The day is 24/10/16. Every 15 second they have been announcing \\\"attention train cruw disabled passenger alarm operating \\\" OMG IT was really really annoying to every passenger after every 15 second for 3 hour probably. Disgusting,  rubbish\",\"We joined the train at Edinburgh travelling first class to Kingscross, ( \\u00a3200 for 3 people cheaper then flying ) every thing about the carriage was first class especially the seats, the train left absolutely on the dot and almost straight away was offered complementary snacks and drinks from some very friendly staff,this service continued through out the journey, I would say that the staff went out of their way to make our journey as pleasant as possible,the ride was very smooth and quiet with the train arriving bang on time at Kingscross. What a excellent service what a excellent experience.A big thank you to all the staff on the 1330 Saturday.\",\"I always receive text messages of my journeys and I get refunded for delays\",\"I was with my husband recently on a trip to London and he was taken ill during the night. I was anxious to get back home as quickly as possible and on arrival at Euston I was lucky enough to speak to Michael, the Train Manager for the West Coast line to Manchester. He was so helpful and assisted us with our seating and made the journey home more comfortable for my husband. Michael and his female boss are 2 young people who are a credit to Virgintrains and I want to highlight that fact by this review.\",\"I traveled last night Manchester to Euston and got caught in the debacle of signal failure at Stafford. We were delayed nearly 2 hours but we were kept informed all through and the train manger could not have been more helpful and professional. Virgini then arranged onward transport via taxi to my final destination because no further trains were available. The easy way it was handled and the clear actions of your train manager, whose name I do not know, will stand you in good stead through adverse times. Credit to you all. Keeping us informed was the key, we all knew what if anything was happening.\",\"The silverline trains are great, spacious & comfortable & a nice layout with a good number of tables all with powerpoints.

According to Virgin, we need guidance on how to get to the station, platforms plans, information about the 'experience' and about our destination. I have never seen anything so infantalising or pathetic in all my life.\",\"I can't speak highly enough of the train manager,Ms Kirsty Smart, on the delayed 20:35 Kings Cross to Leeds on Sunday August 6th (2017). My son and I were travelling on that train and we were both extremely impressed by how efficient and professional Ms Smart was in dealing with a situation caused through absolutely no fault of Virgin trains. The train was absolutely packed because the previous train to Leeds had been cancelled so many people were in danger of missing their last connecting train en route to Leeds. Ms Smart was in constant contact with all the passengers on her train,reassuring everyone that she would do everything in her power to get everyone home - which is exactly what she did! She got every single one of the passengers to exactly where they had to be! She was absolutely amazing ..so calm and proficient as she repeatedly walked up and down the train aisle dealing with connecting passengers on a one-to-one basis.I've been on delayed trains before,I remember the stress and comments from angry passengers, but on this particular train,no-one, as far as I could hear/see was complaining ..quite the contrary actually! Ms Smart somehow transmitted an unusual sense of serenity and was absolutely meticulous in her directions ..for example \\\"passengers leaving the train at station X should disembark at exit door X ..your connecting train is waiting for you on platform X We're arriving on platform X so all you have to do is X\\\" So hats off to Ms Kirsty Smart for her highly professional customer-care skills and hats off to Virgin trains for employing someone who can keep your flag flying even in adverse circumstances!\",\"Virgin trains are terrible to travel with.  Although the acknowledged problems with nasty smells from toilets since 2013 they have not appear to have fixed the problem. So every journey and I travel a lot is an unpleasant experience....

We ended up reserving for a train that would put us in Paris almost at midnight for that price. The ticket was bought last week, and all of a sudden, last night, it appeared that there was a daytime train for the price, after all. We went ahead and changed the time and date for a train that put us in Paris around 11:30am, but we had to pay $48 penalty per person to switch it. Really Eurostar? What kind of predatory tactic is this? I see that the penalty information is visible right before you make the change, but at the end of the day, it is inconceivable to feel OK about paying pretty much for two extra tickets, when all we wanted was to get to Paris at a decent time; and to top it off, you state that if the price is higher at the time of the change, you have to pay the penalty PLUS the difference in fare, BUT if the new fare is lower, then NO  refund would be issued. I mean, regardless of your business reason for doing so, it really hurts to be out almost $100 to exchange a ticket for a different time on the same day for the same price. This is shameful! Shameful!\",\"Extremely horrible customer service. Does not value the customer at all. They would rather take the money and lose a customer in the long run. No business ethics at all. Does not listen to nor understand the grievances of the customer. This is a so-called service company that does not understand the fundamental reason for why they are in business in the first place. Repeats over and over again stock phrases as if the customer is not even a person. They are not helpful at all. They only care about protecting themselves with no considerations on why the customer is legitimately frustrated.

On our return journey, we tried to disembark the train at Manchester only to be pinned against the seats by Manchester Utd fans on their way home, who bombarded the train. They had no allocated seats which meant it was a free for all. My son was on crutches and couldn't move. The response from virgin 6 weeks later was a cheque for \\u00a315 compensation and an email to say if I wasn't happy with the conduct of the football fans,  to contact transport police and it's not their fault if people don't listen to instructions to let people leave the train before getting on.

I called customer service to amend the ticket and was informed I would have to buy a new ticket, pay a cancellation fee and then pick up the original return tickets at the self service machine and post them by recorded delivery to an address in Scotland to get a refund, which would take up to 5 - 7 days to complete upon receipt of the tickets. How in this day an age of digital business  can a train service have a policy so inefficient and unhelpful. You mean to tell me they could not have amended my original booking? I had booked the ticket 1 week in advance, the tickets hadn't been issued and I had called in less than 24 hours. The argument used by Customer Service is that it was my fault and this is the policy of the train lines.\",\"Recently my Girlfriend wanted to buy me a train ticket so that I could go and visit her that day. As I had very little finances at the time I gladly accepted and waited for her to get back to me with news that the ticket had been bought. To my astonishment she called me and said that she was unable to buy me a ticket as I'd need the debit card used to make the online purchase in order to collect it from the Self-collection Machine. How ridiculous! My partner wants to buy me a Ticket and she can't because I NEED HER DEBIT CARD to collect the ticket.\",\"Since Virgin took over from Eastcoastline I have never, ever been allocated the seats in my preferences, facing forward, a table and a power socket. Last night I booked again and found that the 'change seat' tab wasn't working and therefore couldn't change my seat to one I prefer. I tweeted the help service who said that if I book now and ring customer services in the morning they would change my seat no problem. Okay, so I did that and found that for them to change my seat it would cost \\u00a310 for each alteration. I explained that it was Virgin's fault online that I couldn't get the seat I wanted because the website wasn't working properly and was told that the charge would still incur. This is a blatant rip off to allow Virgin to extort more money from customers, the sooner the railways are nationalised again the better.\",\"i travelled from Manchester - London Euston on 29/11/15 departing at 17.35. About 1 hr into the journey we had a message from the train manager explaining that a tree had fallen on the tracks blocking our way and they were currently investigating. Obviously this was annoying for all of us on board and it did cause significant delays to the journey back. Sarah the train manager was excellent at keeping all passengers up to date on what was happening and updating us whenever she could. there is nothing more frustrating that not being told what is going on and this was avoided. luckily they were able to divert the train on a different route. i got home nearly 2 hours later than planned but knew that the train staff did all that they could to make the journey as bareable as possible. After coming into work and praising the staff to all of my colleagues i then received an email saying that i was being automatically refunded for the journey with no forms for me to complete. i was so impressed with this and couldnt imagine this type of service from other train companies.\",\"I booked a return ticket to Glasgow from derby, got as far as Crewe and everything was cancelled. Spoke to customer services at Crewe was told that I'm entitled to a full refund. Ok I thought great, 123.00 the tickets cost.

Don't waste your time with them.\",\"I booked a seat in the quiet coach.

You wouldn't mind so much if you was not paying stupid prices for tickets but you are so expect the service to go with it.\",\"Coach in which I had a reserved seat Edinburgh-London was taken off without warning and no alternative seating provided.  Train was full so had to stand the whole way.  Wrote to complain - first reply was stock answer about delayed trains which obviously irrelevant to the complaint.  When wrote back to point this out and reiterate the actual complaint took them 10 days and then replied to tell me they needed a different reference number from the one supplied to identify the booking.  Sent immediately and phoned to check it was OK this time.  Now told it will be another 10 days before they will review the complaint again.  This is simply not how customer service should work!\",\"Travelled from Manchester to Euston 25/6 for a long weekend break, my husband is wheelchair dependant and we booked assistance which I have to say was exceptional at both Manchester and Euston, the train was bang on time with help  waiting at both ends.. The train manager came for a chat and said to shout up if he could assist in anyway, perfect start and end to our mini break, Thanks Virgin\",\"Found the website easy to use, the staff helpful , the trains on time , clean , a overall service a quality service compared to my local service .\",\"9th September 9.30 am Edinburgh to Kings Cross arriving 13.49 ( or so I thought ) Train broke down twice before we even got to Newcastle adding 30 mins each time. Then got to Doncaster where we were told the train would now be making 5 extra stops. It was supposed to be 3. These extra stops would now make us three and a half hours late. We are all being told we will get our money back, big deal why is it crap service companies think they can solve their serious management failings by giving money back? What about your customers time, frustration , events and meetings missed , how do you value that ? I will never under any circumstances ever use Virgin trains again. This journey had been an abject lesson in truly awful management , yes you see it's the managers who are always trying to save their own skin by using the companies money to bail them out when they screw up. Someone at Virgin Trains put a defective engine on the tracks, they didn't inform passengers when they got on in Edinburgh that there were already delays taking place south of Doncaster which they could have done because they knew and then someone decided to send the same train with the defective engine around 5 more stops.\",\"I have used Virgin trains for years regularly between Liverpool and London and there has been a noticeable decline in standards. The tables are often dirty, the seats covered in bits of food and the smell from the toilets just awful. The food in first class has gone from being perfectly acceptable to poor. Breakfast service at the weekend - tea in a polystyrene cup,  a banana and panettone in a plastic packet. First class? I don't think so. Having the monopoly on the route has made them complacent and they are giving customers less and less but charging them more. I wish there was an alternative because I would switch.\",\"Busy train from Crewe to London.Staff member refused to help me find somewhere to put my luggage ' Not my responsibility.' Train manager later said it was not the responsibility of Virgin to provide luggage space for passengers:' We don't build the trains.' Do Virgin staff take course in unhelpfulness? Is it surprising that the majority of the population want trains renationalised?\",\"What kind of system allows you to book now Alnmouth to Kings Cross for Dec 20th but not for 17 December ?\",\"06/10/2016. Newcastle Upon Tyne Central Station, Virgin staff could'nt have been more helpful to me in my electric wheelchair, Birmingham New Street Station, Virgin staff could'nt have been more helpful. 07/10/2016, leaving Birmingham NEC after the first day of the Star Trek convention, the virgin staff on the platform ignored me, missing two trains the last at 18:29. The result was going back through the NEC where the staff were wonderful directing me to the taxi rank, which I used the following two evenings. This was the first and last time I use Virgin Trains with my wheelchair\",\"I've traveled aboard Eurostar between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and I found it convenient and comfortable. It's about as cheap as flying into Stansted, but you end up at St. Pancras, not an hour+ away from London. Haven't had a bad experience with Eurostar and look forward to travel with them again.\",\"What a difference a year makes. We travelled first class from Edinburgh to London's King Cross almost exactly a year ago and the service and food were very poor quality. Fast forward a year and it has vastly improved. A new James Martin menu has been introduced and it is so tasty. I got chicken curry on the way down and vegetable tagine on the way back. Both were lovely if a tad small - the muffin was moist and tasty - although on the way back they didn't have the advertised desert. The service was prompt and friendly and not stingy with the booze! Our journey was during the week so no idea if it is the same standard at the weekend.\",\"So on Sunday evening I cleverly left my purse in the departure lounge at Lille (last week I left it in the airport in Zurich) and I didn't realise until I was already on my train (I know, I don't deserve to have one). Anyway, the amazingly quick witted managers Stefan and George managed to track me down and accompany my bag on the next train to London! I am so grateful to them and all of the staff. All I had to do was wait in the cushy confines of Pret a Manger, eating my egg mayo sandwich, until my purse was delivered to me in person by Stefan. If that's not great customer service then I don't know what is! In other news, the Eurostar cheese and ham toastie is delicious and the white wine not to Chablis....\",\"I travelled back from Leeds to London Kings Cross, from a work trip, on the 15:15 train from Leeds to London, Kings Cross.  After settling into a seat in Carriage D I decided that I would buy some refreshment for my journey.  After a while a FULLY STOCKED catering trolley came through the carriage.  It served some people in seats two rows ahead of me, then the lady (Rebecca \\u2013 I think it was) quickly whizzed past me and served a gentleman behind me.  I asked TWICE if I could be served but the lady refused, just telling me \\u201cI\\u2019ll be back\\u201d.\",\"Just like all virgin companies virgin trains are a rip off and give terrible service. 0nce again my train from London to Birmingham new street (supposedly the flagship line) was cancelled. Once again the following train was delayed. Once again the train operator didn't bother announcing how late they are and when they are likely to reach new st. The train is currently 25 minutes after when it was supposed to be getting in and dawdling along at walking pace so no idea when it will get in. So I will be getting on for an hour late again and will have missed a number of ongoing connections. Do virgin care? I don't believe so as the one time I could be bothered to ask for a refund for a \\u00a3176 ticket for a train which never went anywhere I have heard nothing 2 months later. I might as well get the slow trains for a fraction of the price rather than the 170 odd quid per day ticket or the \\u00a31000 plus season ticket I currently have. Not happy at all\",\"Virgin Trains disgust me; specifically, the typical default behavior of the staff the employ at all levels disgusts me.\",\"Gare du Nord is a nightmare even by cheap airline standards - as you ascend towards the Eurostar section you are greeted by nice decor which eventually leads to a queue that I can only describe as a vicious nightmare at best - no structure or organization, and even cattle led to slaughter are treated better. I am being reassured that everyone is in the same position (as if I can't see that for myself) and after inevitably being late (nearly a full hour in the queue), I do not even receive an apology (or an explanation) and am simply handed a ticket for a train an hour later. At least they had the decency to ask whether I would like a 4 seat (with table) or 2 seat placement...\",\"First experience with travelling and cannot believe the ridiculously poor booking system.  It's clear that some trains are faster and thus more expensive but it's very unclear that the slow one is the equivalent of riding the tube. After a incorrectly booked ticket and having to get another at the correct time (no sympathy, money lost) - I then paid \\u00a365 for first class but there wasn't anything that justified the price. Also it seems common place for everybody to just pile on regardless if they hold a first class ticket or not. The pricing on the page is not clear- they list standard tickets as off peak and off peak is put under trains that are not off peak. Did I mention it's impossible to tell what direction the train is travelling. I thought on the way home with my booked FC ticket on the fast service things would be better. I arrive, see my platform do go down and get on the train. I happen to look out and see it is a train leaving 20 minutes earlier. Figured it would be fine being not a single person is in the train car. Nope - the miserable guy setting things up might as well said get the hell off. I had an advanced ticket which he referred to as not full price. It is full price just not flexible. As the train is about to pull off I ask the manger who scathed at me with a too bad so sad attitude. Absolutely appalling customer \\\"service\\\". Avoid at all cost. Richard Branson should be ashamed putting his name in this business.\",\"We went to Newcastle from Kirkcaldy on 9th December 2016 and the train was absolutely freezing. The trip back wasn't quite so bad to start with, nice quite carriage we were playing music on our phone quietly with no additional speakers the conductor passed us and said turn that music off no eye contact he just continued walking and said it's not allowed on virgin train in any carraiges. VERY RUDE STAFF. We weren't  being noisy or rowdy and couldn't see anything saying we were not allowed to play music. We certainly were not disturbing anyone. We did ask the other 2 people near us and they said there wasn't a problem conductors attitude was shocking.\",\"I wanted to write a review as I felt the Virgin train staff on the 12.57 from Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston virgin were bloody brilliant. I have been diagnosed with a gluten intolerance recently and find it difficult to find food on the go unless I buy it from a supermarket and make it myself. I was travelling first class and mentioned that I could not have there choice in sandwiches as I was gluten free. Ken told me not to worry he would make me a bacon buttie with gluten free rolls. I was thrilled! I also wanted to say a big thank you to Kev on the same service who was really friendly and nothing was to much trouble. They both made my journey great and made my day. Thanks guys :-)\",\"I've had some very good experiences with Eurostar in the past, but it's going downhill. Extremely annoyed that I wasn't informed they had changed my window forward facing seat that was carefully chosen 3 months ago to a backwards facing aisle seat - apparently they decided to use my original carriage for business class. Why couldn't they e-mail me and let me choose a new seat - or a different train. Eventually I was given a forward facing seat right beside the constantly opening door to the very noisy kitchen car. Really rubbish and not a great start to my EU evaluation week.\",\"1st time I have ever been on a virgin train Kings Cross to Leeds. No heating on the train. I was freezing! I had to use my gloves as my hands were stinging. When we reached Leeds we were shivering with the cold. What a rubbish Service.\",\"Sadistically overpriced. Overcrowded trains: unsafe number of people in carriages (was once given a ticket with no seat reservation from London to Edinburgh, with people crammed into the carriages and left to stand). Uncomfortable seats with no leg room once you do get one. Patronising marketing and design (writing under mirror: 'Go on, give us a smile!'. Not worth the ridiculous price.\",\"Impossible to get compensation for delayed trains from this company. Over a month and no reply at all beyond the automatic acceptance emails (even when registering a formal complaint) is unacceptable.

If you have a choice then pick a different rail company.\",\"I had been waiting for 3 weeks for delay repay compensation for a 2 hour delay from Euston to Birmingham New Street, which made me miss the main act of a UK Hardcore gig I flew in to see from NZ. Two weeks ago, I receive 10 pounds in the form of a cheque, from a ticket that costed 20 pounds. Now I am no mathematician, but it clearly stated on their letter attached with the cheque, that delays running over an hour will be reimbursed 100%. Furthermore, I enquire about further compensation of the Rave ticket+accomodation fees of the hostel as a ticket booth operator at Birmingham New Street mentioned I could request it. It's been 5 weeks now and no reply other than some automatic email response.

There were 4 options in the 24 hours. We picked a package that gave us a train ticket and ferry ticket.  We paid \\u00a35 extra for the option which was the train journey and ferry ticket that got us on the fast boat over to Ireland. Unfortunately the train was delayed by 12 minutes. The result was that we were unable to get on the fast ferry and had to wait 2 hours for the next boat, which as it was a slower ferry meant a delay of 4 hours.  There was a whole train of people affected.  Irish ferries told us that we should not have been sold the ticket.  Virgin has told us that the train operator Arriva is responsible not them. When I pointed out to Virgin that they had sold us something not fit for purpose - the train if on time only gets in 30 minutes before the departure of the fast ferry and the close of check in is 30 minutes before departure, so why were they selling the train journey, they stated that the check in closes 30 minutes before departure or on the arrival of the connecting train - when I said this did not happen, Virgin said they could not comment as it was another companies decision.  Virgin are still selling this package, no other train option is given for the fast ferry (ie an earlier train), I have advise them to put the warning on the booking page that if the train is delayed by 10 minutes they will not be able to get the boat, so at least people are warned and can decide whether they want to waste money on a boat they may not be able to get.  Virgin have completely washed their hands of this, taking no liability for selling the package on their web site.

I had a \\\"chicken caesar\\\" wrap on the way back from Paris which was really soggy, no flavour, just chicken, lettuce and soggy wrap. And it said \\\"use by\\\" the following day - to think what it would have been like after another day!\",\"Had one of the worst experience ever using a service. There is no different from other train companies, apart from being worse and a rip off. Me and my wife ended up paying \\u00a3380 for a journey from Milton Keynes to Edinburgh on second class for the pure fact that the website was very confusing when tickets were bought.\",\"I got tickets to  Liverpool from London Euston on 29th of February. I supposed to change train at Crewe to continue my journey, however there was a major power cut and the connection train was delayed by 1 hr 30 min. I sent a refund request the same day via the website, I got a replay one month later informing me that  the (tickets I supply were not valid!!) Really??? After many emails which were all ignored I managed to get hold of a customers service advisor from the refund team, I gave my details again, then I was put on hold for 20 min, when finally she returned to the phone she said that I was eligible for refund. Yuppiiiiiii.. But the funny thing's that the refund never came and I'm still waiting!! Hahhahah\",\"One star from me and that's only because I can't put none. My daughter and her boyfriend are currently stuck in Brussels because Eurostar will not let them change their train time unless they pay 260 euros on top of what they already have paid. No leeway for a difficult personal circumstance. They have nowhere to go, no money and her boyfriend has been unwell. DO NOT USE THIS TERRIBLE COMPANY.\",\"The UK has the worst national rail service Farcical new summer timetable hasn't been finalised which starts middle May 2018 so unable to research times of trains unable to book trains for late May early June 2018. So much for the standard 12 week advance search now not even 8 weeks as of 31st March 2018.\",\"Me and my boyfriend had to use Virgin to travel to Edinburgh. What got me first was the fact, that even tho Virgin has their own internet service, 3rd class only has 15(!!) minutes of free internet. I'm not originally from the UK and all the trains I've travelled with in Europe had always free internet. For how expensive Virgin's trains are, I'd at least expect that. Our train got delayed on our way from Edinburgh to Newcastle, due to \\\"cleaning\\\" the train, well they put those reservation tickets on the seats but train was still full of garbage from the previous passengers. Train arrived 20 minutes late and we missed our train from Newcastle to Sunderland. Was told we could get the next one, problem was the same line was due in the next hour and we didn't want to wait. Their customer service boot was closed for some reason so we tried asking the lady at the tickets place, if we could get a refund, she said, obviously annoyed, we'd have to do that at where we bought them. Needless to say, I'll try my best to not travel with this company again.\",\"For a princely sum of money (\\u00a390 return) travelled to North Wales from Euston. Started with major herd like rush as platform announced 8 mins prior to departure. Overcrowded train , no leg room , one toilet out of use, the other stunk of vomit... Cheers Richard !\",\"Absolute rip off. They will go the same way as Monarch for taking advantage of customers.\",\"The \\\"ticket sale\\\" has started and my attempts to get my ticket to Liverpool are thwarted.  I don't have a choice of times, so even on the cheaper rate I will be paying almost \\u00a3200.  And they don't mention that,actually, Liverpool station will be closed, so I have no idea where I will be getting off.\",\"When I looked at the reviews for Virgin Trains on Trust Pilot, it confirmed that my own experience with this pathetic company wasn't a 'one-off'.\",\"three hour delay with no clear explanation why... a full refund is only the bare Minimum that should be offered, for arriving at 11pm when you should have been there by 8pm\",\"This is a mixed review based on different criteria.\",\"Seeing on their website that upgrade to 1st was only \\u00a320 we decided to opt in. The host was a star and service from a trolley was good, Internet was great.\",\"Train ride was excellent, food and service is too which is validity enough to buy the tickets. However the first class lounges are poorly kept. TV doesn\\u2019t work amidst a small tournament called theWorld Cup, tables were dirty with cups and litter which made for a poor experience. Very poorly maintained facility which frustrates. Come on Virgin, you\\u2019re better than this surely?\",\"I was getting the 16:33 train to find out it was cancelled so had wait around till 17:33 to find out that was delayed for 16 minutes to see only one coach train came. Had to stand in the middle of the train in this heat with about 30+ other people this didn\\u2019t feel safe, when trying to get off the train had to slide down the train pushing in to other people and struggling to get off the train which resulted in me nearly missing my stop. I just think if they cancel a train they should at least realise that they need a bigger train as a lot people had to wait for the next one I would rated is 0/5 stars if I was able to I won\\u2019t be travelling with them again.\",\"I don\\u2019t want to give a star at all.\",\"Bad bad bad sort yourself out .1 July 2018 .abroad can do why can't we .\",\"My daughter and I recently returned on a Virgin Train West Coast route from London Euston. The train was very overbooked and we voluntarily disembarked before the train left the station\\u2014deciding to wait until the next train we could take on our tickets (an almost four-hour delay as our return tickets were off-peak only).\",\"Travelling from Glasgow to Newcastle \\u201cFirst Class\\u201d.......\",\"beyond disappointed. been using arriva trains for years and now i have a daughter i use trains to travel everywhere, any doctors and hospital appointment ect. no room for my pram, i get shouted at for trying to move the pram and told to not bother coming on trains!\",\"Very poor I have to use the service all the time and have many bad experiences.

I had no problem paying the fine but the man you was talking to me was sarcastic and treated me like a criminal and really unfair!

The web site was on a go slow and then crashed. I finally managed to get as far as the reservation stage and noticed that the seats allocated were not together. Not a problem, I thought, I book train seats regularly. I clicked on the change seats, noted that there were plenty of 4 seats together and 2 opposite, selected and saved. No matter how many times I did this, the new seat selection would not save. I called customer service and was told that it was probably a fault on the web site. I could either book the seats and then try to change them,( not guaranteed) or just delete and start the booking procedure again. I chose the latter as it was imperative that we sat together to prepare for a meeting.  I tried to re-book immediately but the same journey had increased by  no less than \\u00a3 85.10 in the 5 minutes it took to do this!  Obviously I called customer serviced again - they said they couldn't help, no-one in the company could over-ride the web prices!!! I can't believe this is true. Is the company run by machines? I asked to speak to a manager - this was Thursday. I am still waiting for someone to call me back today (Saturday). Nevertheless, we needed to travel to London, I booked the seats, they still didn't allocate together, I tried again to change but the change still not actioned. I booked anyway and then called customer service again - A customer service tele-operator (Joy)  said she would put forward a request but could not guarantee! It would take 72 hours to learn if it was possible!! Is this really a reasonable response! It only took 5 mins to take nearly \\u00a3600 from my credit card but 72 hours to learn if we can actually sit on the train together, despite viewing many together seats.  Joy did not bring much joy and was quite sharp, pointing out that although I could give feedback it wasn't going to make any difference and there was nothing I could do about anything or speak to anyone else.   I still haven't heard back from anyone! As my colleague said - 'Thank you for choosing to travel with Virgin' but do we indeed have a choice. The customer service I received this week was both frustrating, and in the latter part quite frankly rude!\",\"What a con. Thought I was going to be given the luxury treatment after reading the ads. Coffee, soft drink and dried up cheese and tomato sandwiches, no alcohol, delayed train!\",\"My grandchild and two of her friends needed to get to London for an England team training camp. Since they where only children, they needed an adult to take them. My granddaughter, is staying with her other grandparents in England, as she lives in Australia, so my son asked if I could take them. No problem, till I chose Virgin Trains and booked an advance ticket. Unfortunately a couple of days  after booking, I found that I  was unable to take them. Two frustrating days followed, left on hold for 30 mins, trying to get through on numerous occasions. At long last, I was through to INDIA! Patronising, and unable to understand my request. A supervisor finally told me in no uncertain terms that having booked an advance ticket, and that as I was the adult, ALL the tickets where in my name. Even though I had found another adult to take my place, I could not change that name. Basically, I was told to rebook with the new adults name, AND REPAY FOR NEW TICKETS. NO REFUND ON THE ORIGINAL. In my book Virgin trains, that is THEFT.\",\"Just travelled up and down to Scotland on the sleeper and the staff and service has been brilliant.

First the apology \\u2013 train running slowly as approaching a tunnel where a speed limitation is in operation. Then the mitigation: it should not add too much time to our journey today. And then the added value: because we are going so very slowly we have the rare opportunity to see the fantastic engineering work undertaken by the thousands of navies who hand-excavated the tunnel in the 1830s. And especially to see the two enormous brick-lined air shafts they constructed bringing light into the tunnel and allowing us to marvel at their handiwork.\",\"On the 21st September 2015, I travelled on VIrgin Train East Coast to Edinburgh.

It disappoints me that the same service i received in Australia with Virgin is not available here in the UK. I have been back in the UK for 9 weeks and i have booked a ticket to travel to London for a wedding. Now as life has been hectic to say the least i realised i booked the wrong date for my return journey. HONEST Mistake on my behalf. So I call the service line to change my train date and was happy to pay an admin fee for the change as i made the mistake. I was informed quite quickly that you are unable to change the time and will have to buy a new full ticket and forfeit the full price i have already paid!! This is nor fair or reasonable in anyway. Whilst writing this i have been waiting for hold for a manager to be called for me to speak too. VIRGIN get a grip!! You have always prided yourself on being a business where the customer is treated fairly. I am disappointed and this has tarnished the reputation Branson has worked hard to put in place. Disappointed and feel cheated and robbed. At least Turpin wore a mask!! Shame on you Virgin!!\",\"200 pounds a week for overcrowded journeys from Peterborough to London. Most times can't get a seat, trains are dirty, constantly late and of course, there is always a very diligent guard ready to charge you if you don't have the right ticket. Never happened to me, but I wonder why Virgin can't be financially punished by constantly delivering a bad service. They offer peanuts compensation for cancellations, and even so, they always try to deliberately delay \\\"on time\\\" services, so delayed trains can go ahead to reduce their delays, before they get caught in the compensation threshold.\",\"Decent service if you want to wake up in the centre of London.  Do not expect much privacy though, the staff knock on your door and enter without your permission about 2 seconds later!\",\"The 2 minute door locking policy gets defended to the nth by the staff. It makes no sense on any level to advertise train times that are different from the time you need to be in the platform. Why why why do Virgin staff get so defensive about it rather than sympathising with customers and promising to fight it from below?\",\"I traveled 4 or 5 times this year with eurostar.\",\"The price we pay for tickets are not worth it. The toilets are dirty and the toilet floor is often wet. Even when you reserve seats someone else is the seat you or Virgin have double that seat. it's pathetic. Where on earth do this company get away with daylight robbery e.g up to \\u00a3500 for a journey. No one would ever pay that much for a ticket and that's not even 1st class. The fact is the government should never of privatised British Rail. it was fine as british Rail.\",\"The whole train smelled....like vomit...vestibules worse. Toilets mostly inoperable and the one I found open was filthy. This is not the first time. Tray tables not clean...nor between seats...horrible buildup.

WE PAID FOR SEATS !\",\"So I'm going to France in a few days. I wanted to change my 7:55am train to a 9:17am train as I've found out that I won't be able to check into my accommodation till 4pm in Fontainebleau. So I tried to change tickets online and I was quoted \\u00a3135 - oh and there is a credit card fee. If you try to call them to change tickets it's a \\u00a310 fee + credit card fee + \\u00a3135. What a disgusting exchange policy. Even worse than easyjet and Ryanair! Next time I'm taking the ferry. Eurostar have lost my faith and custom. It is unjustifiable to charge so much to change tickets. \\u00a310 okay, but \\u00a3135?!?! Does Eurostar think money grows on trees?\",\"Complete waste of time and money. We sat down at the cleanest looking table, none had been wiped or cleaned. The Gentleman (or not) serving us in a carriage (Which was empty save for being occupied by my husband and I) threw us a sandwich (only ham and egg to offer) and threw down the napkins. Brushed past us again only to sit himself down behind us eating his lunch for the duration of the journey. Disgusted and feel ill treated considering we have paid double to upgrade...\",\"I have sent three complaints to this company. Not one response.\",\"I used to work in London and return to my family in Holland a few times a month. There is nothing like the Eurostar. For the same price as a ticket from Stansted, you get to travel straight from St Pancras to central Brussels. The only suggestion I have is to cooperate with Thalys to have one integrated service to the Netherlands. Right now, with all the high speed rail issues we've experienced in the Benelux, it is a right pain to have to change to a slow train from Brussels to the Netherlands. I spend as much time on the Brussels to Holland train as on the Eurostar, despite living on the Dutch-Belgian border (less than an hour by car). That's a true pity. I know you're not the same company, but at least you could start a joint venture for a combines Thalys-Eurostar service!\",\"Train delayed resulting in me missing my connection complained to Virgin Trains my complaint was ignored have now sent 6 E Mails still no reply this companies service is a disgrace.\",\"Eurostar:\",\"Not just my first long distance journey but my first time in First Class.\",\"Why do companies like Virgin think its fine to overcharge their customers?\",\"We have booked to travel to Durham on Monday using Virgin East Coast trains. Today I received an email offering us the chance to upgrade to First Class for \\u00a320 each. We decided to do so, as it seemed like a relatively reasonable price to make the journey a possible treat. However I then noticed that this \\\"offer\\\" could not be used in conjunction with our Senior railcards. This restriction seemed so illogical and downright mean minded that I rang Virgin's customer services to check if it was correct. The first time I worked my way through the irritating phone menus to what I thought was the right option I was subjected to loud music for several minutes and then the line went dead. The second time I tried a different route through the menus and did speak to a customer assistant, in what seemed to be a non UK call centre, which I do not object to on any grounds other than it seems to be ridiculous to be discussing a trip to Durham with someone who is probably on the Indian sub continent. Anyway, he confirmed that we could not upgrade to First Class if we had used our railcards when booking but said that this was the general rule and that he could give me another number to try to see if perhaps there could be an exception, or so the implication was. I waited for several minutes for him to return to give me this number (the matter of seconds surely) again listening to unpleasant loud music, and then put the phone down myself in frustration.\",\"They will not inform you of any changes and when they say look at their website for update it, they only update much later on after they made changes after weeks , and when they say they offer rail replacement, they are either late or don't even show up!\",\"I cannot express in words how much I urge you all not to travel with Eurostar. Eurostar is a greedy company obsessed with money and filled with rude and unsympathetic staff. I don't think they have any compassion for their customers and I honestly think they see each one as a walking wallet, rather than a human being with a beating heart.\",\"I bought a ticket for a virgin train which I subsequently missed by one minute (despite running) as there were works going on at one of the underground stations which delayed my journey. When I went to the ticket office to explain they told me there was nothing they could do other than pay for a new ticket and get a different service. They would not refund my ticket and said I would have to get in touch with southeastern about a possible refund. It is unbelievable that you can pay \\u00a365 for a ticket and then have such an appallingly bad service. If I could give no stars I would. Rude, incompetent and money-grabbing!!\",\"People from 3 different-timed trains directed to only one, coach D (my reservation) was apparently non-existent and we were eventually told to go to coach C, wherein the reserved seats were already completely blocked up by people on coach C, who were then told to go to coach F? Terrible planning in the Ace of cancellations, but I've been on Virgin Trains before and it's been completely smooth and an easy journey. Don't think I will be travelling with them again, though, in case something like this happens again\",\"16/02/2017 travelled with Virgin Train from Edinburgh to Inverness via Pitlochry. The updated Virgin trains are so comfortable and the service from the staff was excellent. We travelled first class at a very reasonable fare and was happily surprised with the comfort and service. If you compare the Virgin service to the Scotrail service on the same line then Virgin trains sits head and shoulders above Scotrail both in comfort and Service. I am not normally a fan of train travel in the UK but this experience has changed my opinion. Normally we would hire a car for the journey but on this occasion the train turned out to be amazing. If you are flexible when you travel you can get great deals. I highly recommend using the Virgin east coast train service and we will definitely be using again. So relaxing not having to drive and have an enjoyable meal and plenty of free drinks on the way. Well done Virgin you have converted a non-train user.\",\"The train was very impressive just looking st the outside. I was sat in first class and it felt as if I was in a plane. The train was very long and looked after. Was treated to free food and drink of which we're both very nice. The train was quiet and very fast. An overall perfect experience you want when traveling the country. I'll be using this way of travelling from now on.\",\"Appalling service at Marne le vallee chessy station on Monday 6th March.\",\"All I will say is that if Virgin were as good at running a service as they are at saying sorry, I'd probably be a happy customer.\",\"Whilst usually I find national rail journeys good, there have been several occasions on south west trains where the service is unsatisfactory!\",\"Unbelievable that they are fast at accepting you money but you can not get it back if you are unable to travel even with a week before the trip. You can get an other ticket but then you have to pay 30 pound and have a fixed date!\",\"The check in process is as smooth as can be expected for international travel these days and certainly better than most airports.

Me (17) and my dad (55) have been fined \\u00a3101 for getting on an early train which is out of 'offpeak' times. Apparently a train at 5:10 instead of 5:00 makes all the difference. The woman is called Karen and her customer service is bloody awful. We were polite the interior time and she walked off repeatedly.  She needs a bloody lesson in customer service, and Richard Branson needs to learn a thing about ripping people off for getting a train 10 minutes past the original one on an 'off peak open return' makes all the difference! Joke of a company\",\"Got our tickets fixed by James. It took awhile but it's not his fault.\",\"I had a really bad experience with Eurostar. I went onto the website to change my outward journey from London - Paris. After I made all the changes selecting the new date and time, entered my credit card details and pressed submit, the website crashed and came back with an error message. Checking my emails to make sure I didn't get an email to confirm - I re- entered the information and my credit card again. On later checking my emails, I not only received an email for the intial time I tried to change and got an error message, I also received another email which changed my inbound journey back to London which was very strange as I did not even see the return date mentioned. Only having selected the outbound journey to amend. As I was travelling in the US at the time I automatically went onto the online help and communicated to a customer service person what had happened. I was advised by the customer service person to call the helpline to get the change made and I explained that I could not do this as I was travelling on an Australian mobile and the cost to do this would be too high. I asked the customer service representative to make a note on my record that I had been in contact and advised that I would call the customer service  line as soon as I got to the UK. I also sent an email explaining the situation, hoping that I would get a response prior to having to make the call. I followed up by email every day and received not a single reply.\",\"I don't know if anyone has had as much difficulty as I have getting hold of Virgin East Coast Lost Property. I lost a bag over a month ago and after having filled in the online lost property form three times, two complaints and countless phone calls with no answer to all of the relevant lost property numbers I must draw the conclusion that they don't have anyone who works in lost property.

The  queue management for immigration control was amateur at best. We had two children under 4 years and waited in a queue for about an hour only to find that as we got close to the stairs leading up to UK immigration control, at least 6 further queues had formed and people were jostling to get in. Eurostar staff were managing best they could but surely it should be possible for Eurostar to organise the queue to prevent the whole thing becoming farcical. The whole Eurostar experience was spoilt by this episode.\",\"I'm afraid this is another tale of woe.  My poor son went traveling to Paris with his friends for a break after his A levels.  They arrived half an hour before departure only to be told check-in closed 2 minutes ago.  Particularly galling as the train itself was late.  Staff were unhelpful, disrespectful to the youngsters and rude.  They smirked behind the small print and charged them \\u00a330 extra to go on a later train.  Remonstrating with customer service met with obtuse meaningless responses.  My advice is to avoid at all costs, especially if you are a young person on a budget.

Maybe if there were more staff I might not be starving my butt off writing this. \\u00a3100+ for a ticket is a joke. Do not travel first class it is an omni shambles\",\"When we booked our first ever trip and seats on the Eurostar, we didn't know that it was a theme park ride. Honestly it was so nostalgic to revisit how things were in the 1990's. when power outlets were considered an optional extra for the rich and famous, when wifi was a pipe dream for science fiction buffs and when brown and grey seat coverings were seen as minimally futuristic. The customer service and helpfulness also hark back to the last century. Was really looking forward to this trip the next time I go to Disneyland Paris, might try a steam boat instead.\",\"Compared to other rail networks in the UK Virgin is way ahead. Using Virgin nearly every week to travel down to London I'm regularly impressed by the customer service training of staff and efficiency of operations as well as the relative comfort of carriages compared to other networks. If you book ahead the cost can be fantastic value - even during peak hour.\",\"Regarding a train journey from Kirkcaldy to London that was 37minutes late!!!!\",\"I do not understand why people are leaving negative reviews on the National Rail page, for complaints against specific journeys and the service received from specific journey providers (such as Northern Rail,  Transpennine Express etc (TPE)). National Rail are not responsible for those, only the services they themselves offer, such as timetables, purchasing tickets etc. If you have a problem with Cross Country trains, surely you complain to Cross Country and leave a review on the Cross Country specific page?!\",\"Shocking customer service. if you actually get through to them\",\"Poor service. Train to Leeds cancelled just now after everyone told it was preparing for boarding. I now have to wait 45 minutes for another service (it would have been 30 minutes but the next one is already late). Not that staff were outright unhelpful but simply disinterested in the plight of their passengers. This is Virgin east coast personnel on the station. I strongly suspect I will now have to stand half the way to Leeds. This happened to my wife last time she was Kings(makes you very) Cross too.\",\"Shame Eurostar seems to have a bad rep, but nothing can be better than the experience of booking over the phone. This gentleman was fantastic. I was booking a trip to Lyon and he knew the city so well, giving me tips while completing the booking. What a great experience. Also was able to warn me of engineering works that were happening which allowed me to change my mind on dates (online didn't mention this). Additionally how the passport control works on the way back (apparently need to get off the train somewhere on the way and get the passport checked and get back on board). Wish I got his name - legend.\",\"Instead of having a 40 minute journey, I had a 1 hour 30 minute journey due to someone jumping in front of a train which caused two cancellations. These were not made clear and the three staff members there were sat on a bench with their arms crossed. Then the train took a further 10 minutes than stated to get to the platform which also was not made clear. By the time the train finally came at 11:57 I didnt think it was still morning, I thought it was at least sometime in the evening, if not sometime next year.\",\"Always breaks down.

Firstly, their app is not working properly (1,7 stars out of 5 in Google Play). I purchased my ticket online and it was supposed to load in the app's wallet. Unfortunately, it didn't and therefore i had to go to the ticket desk in King's Cross and ask them to help me. A helpful lady tried to call internally but no one was there to answer the call and advice on what to do! As the train was leaving shortly, she decided to give me a handwritten piece of paper (with an official stamp) stating that i have paid for the ticket. I had the booking confirmation with the date, price and an email saying my card was charged. All evidence was there. Yet, the ticket inspector was extremely rude. In front of the passengers he humiliated me. I have never felt so awful in my life, it made me feel like i was a thief. I had paid 134 pounds for a one way ticket to Edinburgh from London (!!) but he didn't care at all if the app malfunctioned or if i had paid my ticket.\",\"Cancelled our train which was bad enough although possibly unavoidable but....refused to compensate our hotel stay that we paid for and lost the money for at NO FAULT of our own!! Very disappointed and disgusted at that awful customer service. Do not know how they can justify us being out of pocket when they cancelled the train and couldn\\u2019t make arrangements for us to even go the next day! This meant 2 nights hotel stay paid for and lost. Sorry Eurostar but this is NOT ACCEPTABLE!\",\"I booked a ticket on my company credit card which, according to the website, was accepted.

I was told quite categorically that the problem was with my card!\",\"Its getting worse i do the KX to Dundee on a monthly basis and to be trueful Im considering driving rather than putting up with the terrible standard of Virgin trains. When i first started using this service the food was not bad at least it was presentable now you get soggy sandwhich in plastic cardboard packaging and a menu that screams cheap crap. The staff are rude and very unhelpful. My recent journey spent over 5hrs with air-con on so high i could have been in Siberia (a journey i should imagine of better standard than this train service) if you asked the staff to adjust the system not only do they pass the buck their dam right rude. As for the toilets what is that about they stink to high heaven and really need a good clean, someone obviously doesn't know about hygiene standards. But why should virgin care they have the monopoly and one more passengers complaint is not going to make any difference to Richards pockets. At least I've made my thoughts known\",\"I travel every week on Virgin......but beware they say you can reserve seats that reflect you preference and also that there is a way to change the allocated seat. My preferences are recorded as 1st class individual seat facing direction of travel......for the last 10 weeks i have been allocated a backwards facing seat at a table of 4 and there is no way the system will allow me to change the system.\",\"\\\" Thank you for traveling with Virgin Trains!\\\" That's the announcement at the end of every journey to and from London. Well...your welcome but it's not like I had a choice as you have the monopoly on the route. Still cant get my head round how this franchise system is good for the consumer but he ho back to Virgin. For the price of an all inclusive week end break in the lakes for 2 you can travel to London in 2 hours. Your tickets are always checked with a smile and the cramped seats are ok as long as your not sat next to somebody larger than average. For the price of an All inclusive weeks holiday in Europe you can travel First Class unless you book 4 years in advance and travel 14.11 precisely :)\",\"Just terrible. Advertised a ticket at one price then couldn't sell it to me because of a technical glitch; made me buy one that was double the price and write off to their customer service where I would \\\"definitely get a refund\\\".. two months of emailing and calling and getting told I was in the wrong place... just totally, totally incompetent. Finally got my money back two months later.\",\"I was extremely impressed by the service I received yesterday from the web  support team, in relation to a problem whereby I had requested my ticket to be posted to my home address, but due to illness I had not been able to get home to collect it. The operator who sorted out the problem for me (Ellen) could not have been more courteous and helpful. I was extremely impressed with the standard of service - the best I've had from anyone in ages - well done Virgin East Coast!\",\"Had a great experience on the train from Newcastle to London today.

To cut a long story short, she arranged it so we could all travel together. She was friendly, efficient and made a difficult situation 100% better. It is easy to find fault with the train services but it is such a pleasure to deal with helpful staff and they should get the recognition they deserve. Keep up the good work Helen, we will look out for you again when we pass through Newcastle station.\",\"Why bother. Late and expensive.\",\"Just before Christmas.

Having a horrible experiance. Very unfriendly and unhelpful staff.  Only would like to know why they wont give me what they offered me.\",\"Took the 18.15 from Reading to Macclesfield once a week every week last year. Nearly 3 hours to travel 170 miles.  Only once tried standard class - utterly vile.  Scrum to get on.  Old small seats so packed up against other people with nowhere to put a suitcase.   Had to upgrade (at my own not employer expense) to first class just to get a seat.  Too few carriages resulting in appalling inhumane overcrowding.  People pressed against the glass like flies, and sitting/standing in every available inch of toilets, carriages and corridors.  Surprisingly little abuse from  passengers - in France there'd be riots if people were treated this badly.  Grotty trolley clatters eventually through in first class and had to pay for 'dinner' in the form of the measly overpriced cheese & pickle sandwich, crisps and warm wine or warm beer.  (Eventually cracked and now travel from Slough to Paddington across London to get to Euston for a 'proper' Virgin train home.  Not much better but less stressful).   Typical CrossCountry first class booked online in advance ticket price: around \\u00a3250 return.  Shocker.  Avoid.\",\"Truly appalling service.  Bought a ticket for my partially sighted father on the understanding that he would only have to change trains once during his journey; a change that we clued him up for and he was happy about.  The price of the ticket was truly extortionate but we felt we had put him in a position of safety.  On the day, due to industrial action which we were not notified of, he ended up being shunted from train to train making a total of four changes and never actually reaching his final destination as we picked up a station before to save him the stress of yet another change.  He was almost three hours late on the original arrival schedule and Cross Country are refusing to refund the cost of the ticket because he neglected to keep track of what times he got onto the various trains he was forced to use.  He was just intent on getting home in one piece. Taking notes of times was not part of his plan for the day, he just went where he was told to go in a state of confusion and panic that robbed him of his dignity.  The lack of humanity and decency displayed by Cross Country trains is abhorrent.  Don't use them.\",\"It seems most of what I was about to write has already been covered in these reviews. All I will say is that the fact that they have done so little to rectify this dreadful customer review score is a clear example of what any of our opinions means to them.\",\"Outrageous monopoly from London to Manchester, pretends to be a cool brand with stupid joke messages in train toilets, it is a tight business with no flexibility nor regard to its customers. Impossible to get a refund on missed train, very rude customer service at euston station.\",\"RIP OFF!\",\"I had booked a train ticket from Scunthorpe to Birmingham international. It was almost double the price to book from Doncaster to Birmingham international so I booked this instead as it was the same train (which just shows how they manipulate prices from busier destinations). This train was cancelled on very little notice, maybe 5-10 minutes at the most. I was forced to book a taxi to reach the airport in time for my flight. I then sent an email to there team which took well over 2 weeks to get a response. I was told I was not eligible to claim any expenses on the taxi I had to pay for and also I had to post my ticket back for the train that never even departed to get my money back. I told them why do I need to do this, clearly their system should automatically credit customers their money back for cancelled journeys, instead of wasting their time in the hope they will not send the ticket back. Will defiantly avoid them in the future.\",\"National rail is the worst company in Britain. In other developed countries trains run regularly and on time and the company cares when things go wrong. In other developed countries trains are quick and comfortable. Not in Britain. I am currently sat on an already delayed train which is pointing in the direction of Brighton but hasn't moved for the past 15 minutes due to a 'problem'. We have been given no other information nor how long we expect to wait. This is typical of the British railway system and I am in no way surprised; it is second nature for me to factor delays into my journeys now. One positive is that there is no need to worry about missing your train in Britain as they are always at least 5 minutes late, and often closer to 15. I am now stood on the platform of an unknown station after being kicked off the train to Brighton which was deemed unservicable, and I am still not surprised. The price I payed for this third-world service was appalling and the price of trains in general means it is often cheaper to fly to your destination via Spain or Ireland, as well as quicker, easier, more reliable and more comfortable. The entire British rail system is a national disgrace from head office to the 'service' itself. Someone is currently locked in the toilet of the unservicable train and as a result it cannot move to make way for the replacement. The temperature is minus 3. I wish I had slept at Luton Airport until the busses recovered from the horrific two-inch snowfall and resultant traffic chaos.\",\"Terrible communication from staff st Stockport train station. They announced the next train on platform 2 was the 10.16 to Bristol temple meads. But it wasn\\u2019t.

Virgin customer relations are simply terrible they show no compassion or are in any way reasonable. I had paid for a Virgin East Coast train and at a peak cost I was not trying to fare dodge or de-fraud the company but they show no interest in customer relations. I am someone that has used Virgin East Coast regularly up till now. I shall not use them again and will look into legal action and writing to my local MP\",\"What a joke virgin trains are travelled from Edinburgh to Warrington understand because of the bad weather trains were disrupted but no working toilets no hot drinks and no communication from staff why we were stuck for over 2 hours baby had to be changed on table left a bag on train no response to e mails phone calls or messages will try and avoid using them in future\",\"The website always has a problem.

So I tried and tried numerous times (and I really mean numerous) to book and pay for a ticket on the Saturday evening with no success as it always came up with an error message. So tried and tried again the following morning again with no success, so eventually had to give in and had to phone up to place my order for my tickets.......\\\"yes sir we've been having problems with our website, but that'll still cost you \\u00a310 for booking over the phone!!!!!!\\\"\",\"Trains are always overcrowded, and are delayed or cancelled more often than not.

My tickets were now useless and as I was told not refundable even though I had taken an insurance. The said insurance was supposed to cover the cancellation fees but it was not advertised that economy tickets were not refundable. Thanks to Eurostar I wasted 300 pounds. So I urge anyone wanting to travel with this company (I would advise you not to but should you anyway) to check about a good hundred times where you are going and when and not to waste more of your money on a useless insurance.\",\"8.30 AM Virgin Train to Glasgow.\",\"My train from Birmingham New Street was cancelled due to mechanical failure.

It took me FOUR hours to get from Birmingham to Harpenden Herts, which should have taken no more than 2.

After I booked it and realised, I went on there again and filmed my booking process as proof I was not making this up and it showed there was a technical error and it was redirecting me to a different train time that I originally selected. When I rang East Midlands and explained it to the man on the phone he told me I was lying and the website wouldn\\u2019t do that, so I offered to email the video over as I needed to get on my train for work. The man on the phone gave me a fake email, and he also told me it would take 3 days for them to reply to me.

Even though I had proof this was not my fault and it was there website, he was rude and couldn\\u2019t care less that I had to get to work.

about \\u00a350 on a single trip using NationalRail to pick specific trains that are inexplicably cheaper than the surrounding journeys. It's easy to use and looks good. Very good!\",\"First I think the trains are pretty good most of the time.  BUT, when you have a poor journey and need to let Customer Service know, they take a long time to reply.  I paid nearly \\u00a3500 for a first class ticket that was far from first class and the service very poor.  Customer Services tried to fob me off with a \\u00a320 voucher!  That wouldn't get me very far.  I wrote to express my disappointment and after sending proof of  the cost of my ticket, they offered me compensation.  A First Class return ticket.  They sent me a code to use, but turns out it was a 'promotional code' which could only be used during certain times  and would expire at the end of May- not much good for me when I am working most of the times it was available.  I contacted them again, was told I could have a new code, which would be valid for 6 months but I would have to wait for the first code to expire.  What a nonsense.  Sadly, a different person dealing with my complaint every time.  Not helpful, not sorry, not bothered about customers.  Shocking.\",\"I phoned National rail to find out why several trains had been cancelled to Brighton, none of the advisers spoke English and told me to check the website. Turns out they cancelled a load of trains just because the train guard didn't show up, meaning many people were stranded at Southampton Central, including myself who had a plane flight to catch early the next morning. Southampton Central is easily the worse run station ever, they seem to cancel trains all the time for absolutely no reason then give you stick for attempting your journey another way or tell you try again tomorrow and merely shrug their shoulders when you ask what is going on. I have also witnessed a member of public being verbally harassed by one of the train guards when she was desperately trying to get home but they cancelled many trains for absolutely no reason. Seems they all want to go home early and stick their feet up.\",\"I would like Richard Branson to travel on one of his first class train trips to see just how first class it is Not\",\"I was travelling from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston at 10:35, one of 2 journeys on my way to spend New Years in Paris!\",\"Travelled for the first time in first class at it was first class, would recommend to anybody if the ticket prices were as close as mine (not much to upgrade) made my journey very easy and were accomdating after the tube made me late for my train.

I booked my trip to Paris via the Eurostar app and it was booked within a minute, however - you can only book a train from London in the UK, I don't live in London so I had to book another train ticket separately or go onto the desktop website to book it from Birmingham (which to me - seems counterproductive as what's the point in having the app?) so on a whole, the UX on the app is good if you're living in London but anywhere else in the UK? Not so much...\",\"On the 30th of May.

It is not hygneinic to have a carpet in an area which is so frequently walked upon and would be impossible to clean. The Toilet could be better DESIGNED and not look and smell so dirty. They could have odor or spray bottles on a timer. I still feel sick two hours after my journey.\",\"I bought tickets for me and my daughter to Brussels, but I can't go due to recovering from the surgery (post ticket booking and unforeseeable). They will not refund but offered me a change of date!! Great I thought take my daughter away for a couple of days at Xmas as our summer holidays have had to be cancelled!!  After changing the dates, they then asked me to pay \\u00a3149 in admin charges to change the tickets!!\",\"My experience with National Rail was god awful! Firstly I received no ticket information from them after purchasing a ticket, so I called them up and then got it sorted, I tried to make a point that it was not fair that i had to receive the information half an hour before the trains departure, so I was redirected to the Team Leader Becca, who then firstly gave me a snide attitude for asking for compensation or even a proper explanation for something other than \\\"System fault\\\", and then also talked me while literally giggling. How is this right? The fact that they treated me like dirt when they messed up my ticket.\",\"e-tickets are non refundable and you can't change the date and time of this ticket either, had to spend more money.

I understand that these are unavoidable and you just have to make the best out of a bad situation. The staff on the train were very helpful and could not have done more. They explained to me to get on the next train and pay the difference in fair then attach all my evidence and sent to virgin who would compensate me for me loss.\",\"I have to travel to London at least twice a year for family or work related purposes and usually go through Preston. Nearly always there seems to b a problem at Preston that delays the journey by hours - usually something that was known about in advance. Trains cancelled without notice, trains unable to go further without a train supervisor or a driver. I now fly to London rather than take train. I have just gotten off the phone to my sister who is stranded on a train that is sitting at Preston (on her way to Liverpool) and will not be going further. They are waiting for a staff member to appear to inform them what to do next. She has a course at 9am tomorrow. The likelihood is she will have to take a taxi from where she is and have to fight for reimbursement. At times like this Virgin staff are useless, rude, and evasive if they do appear however are mostly non-existent. Virgintrains...you are terrible.

Yes, now and again something can go wrong but there is a level of acceptance from both ends, which can be rectified and sorted out either there and then, or by the customer service later. But being denied entry to a train that I have booked and have a reservation, then being told to get the next one in an hour, with no seat reservation, and wait an extra 30mins for the driver to turn up.... all the while wondering whether or not I was going to be stuck at my transfer destination of York because no more trains were running.... NOT acceptable. How about you honor your agreement and allow your customers to get on the train that they paid for, and sit in the seat that is reserved for them! I didn't make it to the destination I paid for, so had to pay \\u00a320 extra for a taxi on top of the disruption that was caused to my journey . Even still, when I sent a message to Virgin trains, I got a reply saying its not their problem pretty much, rather it was a different part of Virgin trains that is responsible and they will forward the message. I waited 2 months for a reply....NOTHING. Then sent another message, with an automated response saying I will hear from them in 10 days. It has been 40 days!

Only problem is I can't sign in to book tickets.  My password is never accepted. I've tried changing it and even using a separate email account to set up another account. The site lets me sign in, then choose tickets, then, just as I want to go forward it asks me to sign in again.  You've guessed it, the password fails.\",\"There's bad. Then there's Virgin West Coast. I tried to change my seat on a booking with Advance First Class. What a joke. I have to cancel the booking, get a refund and start again. Or, if closer to the booking, probably lose it. Seriously? Go to an airline, even with a restricted ticket, or even with Virgin East Coast, and swap your seat. After all, you're not changing train time or date. Simply a seat? The most customer-unfriendly approach you can take. I will go by car before I endorse this approach again. The feedback was: \\\"you are amending, and that's a 'change' so you can't\\\". Sure, restrict ticket elements. I get that: date and time. But a seat? Get real. Its taking 'restricted' to another level.\",\"Staff are very rude and unhelpful at Birmingham New Street\",\"We bought a two together rail card for our travel from Carlisle to London. Unfortunately the card did not arrive in time and I was planning on showing the purchase details of the card with the expiration date, passenger names and reference number as proof that we had purchased a card it simply didn't arrive in time for our journey. The train manager was very rude and abrupt saying about the terms and conditions of the train tickets and we had to purchase complete new tickets, even though she acknowledged that the information on my account proved I had purchased a rail card.. The tickets were FAR more expensive than online prices meaning we will be paying over \\u00a3400 pounds in total for our journey. This seems like taking advantage of passengers who have made honest mistakes. It does not seem like a system that is set up in the interests of the customer and entraps them into paying extortionatly   large sums of money, also the customer service was appalling. We were treated like criminals when me and my pregnant wife are paying customers. Really disappointed. Probably\\u200b will be taking the car from now on. I understand you have a system but I feel there must be some leeway in the face of extenuating circumstances which doesn't involve robbing customers blind! I will be sharing this experience with friends and family advising them to avoid Virgin trains on the basis that it is an unfriendly and unfair service.\",\"Last week my family and myself completed our return journey from Birmingham airport to Newport south wales comprimising of: Birmingham international to Birmingham new Street - Birmingham New Street to Bristol Parkway and Bristol Parkway to Newport. Having had a poor journey to Birmingham international 14 days previous due to ignorant unhelpful platform staff at Newport and Birmingham ( At Newport they were more interested at sitting in there cabin than helping) we thought that things could only get better, how wrong were we. Well lets start at the beggining: After arriving via the shuttle to Birmingham International at around 8.45pm we could find nobody to ask what platform we needed for a train to Birmingham New Street so we had to figure it out ourselves via the info screens. Having arrived at Birmingham new street we spotted a platform guard so we waited for him to dispatch the train and asked him for the platform we needed to catch our train to Bristol Parkway well he was very rude and told us he did not know so we would have to use the info screen upstairs, what chance have we got of trains running smoothly if he did not know what train runs from what platform?. Having dragged our luggage between us 5 adults and 3 young children we figured it out. Arriving at Bristol Parkway we asked the platform attendant for the right platform for Newport expecting the same attitude as the last guard but to our suprise he was extremely helpful giving us the info we needed and helping us with the lift and pointing out that we could use the waiting room pointing out that we could turn the heaters on as we had over an hour to wait but then came the bad news the train was delayed due to signalling issues. Once the train arrived the guard was very helpful and helped us board the train as we had 6 pieces of luggage. Once on the train more bad news was announced \\\" Due to signalling issues we had to do a detour that would add around 45 minutes to our journey \\\" just what we did not need.We arrived at Newport at 02.15 instead of 01.27.

Long story short there was a glitch with the system reading my wife's visa (no fault of ours). It would take overnight to resolve the visa issue due to the embassy being on public holiday. As a result the boarder security assured us Eurostar would transfer the ticket. Boarder security took us to the Eurostar desk in which they stated they would transfer the ticket after ping ponging us between multiple staff members. They said they would transfer once the visa issue had been resolved first. The visa issue was rectified overnight as expected and upon returning the next day Eurostar staff refused to honour there word. The treatment and attitude from the desk was the worst I've ever experienced. With my wife in tears they forced us to pay for a new ticket forfeiting our old one. The initial ticket was around 100 pounds for 2 people one way. The man at the counter with a big smug smile requests 395 pound for the new tickets knowing we had no other choice as we'd already spent a fortune in lost accomodation and additional hotel for the night. Absolutely disgusting company. I contacted the Eurostar help online thinking they would be appalled by this staff members attitude and honour the initial agreement but no this company are scum all the way from the top to bottom. Consider this a strong warning DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! FLY SWIM WALK BUT AVOID EUROSTAR AT ALL COSTS!\",\"Can we just jump in & defend the wonderful staff we had on our virgin train journey to London on Thursday 8th June (at 8.40am).

I booked tickets in advance as I like to be organised. However, my boyfriend is in the forces and has been deployed away for 4 months quite suddenly. We booked the train for our last week together before he left and obviously were devastated when we couldnt go. I asked the trainline if they could refund it and they said yes but at a charge of \\u00a340. However, my mother and I would be travelling to the same destination in two months time. They refused to swap the tickets over and charged more for the same journey in august PLUS the \\u00a340. Both virgin and the trainline agreed to this and wouldnt refund us. They wouldnt even take money off our next journey. They spoke to us like dirt and GREEDILY took our money. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE IF YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. My boyfriend is off defending our country and these greedy companies dont care and have no empathy. I am also a student so \\u00a340 is a big deal to me. Cannot believe the service I received - they should BOTH be ashamed.\",\"I love virgin trains and they are my first choice when available to travel across country, however when having to travel from Birmingham international I dread it as the virgin staff there are like no other. They are rude abrupt and if asked a question or for advice they let you know that you are causing them\",\"unbelievable inefficient customer support. Bought a ticket to from London to Dublin Connolly.  When I've arrived to Dublin port I had to pay the transfer from Dublin port to Dublin Connolly. Virgin explanation was\",\"Having booked travel for 4 people for a business trip & opt to print tickets with the traveller's individual names on it, I had a change of circumstance that required one name to be changed a week before we were due to travel.  I called Virgin Trains on 0344 556 5650 only to be greeted with constant patronising and obtuse conduct that I would expect Virgin Trains to be way beyond in their quality of service.  As I was getting nowhere, I demanded to speak to a supervisor who was about 90% as difficult as the last rep.  As an exception, they agreed to refund the one ticket I needed to change and processed the purchase of a new, more expensive ticket for the same journey, just with a new name on the ticket.  For this pleasure, there was a \\u00a320 admin fee (which I managed to get waived) and a \\u00a320 hike in ticket price.\",\"I arrived half an hour early for the Paris to St Pancras. Their systems had failed and we had to queue really far. I asked a lady holding up a sign whether I was missing my 7.13 am train at least 3 times and she told me I was on the right queue and to get back in the queue. At check in they said I was late and that I should buy a new ticket for 200 Euros from SNCF. They were not taking responsibility for their broken systems but quickly wanted me to pay for a new ticket. I looked for the manager who told me I could pay 40 Euros to catch another train but they had no clue when their own ticket office would be opening! What a strange state of affairs! Definitely some sort of scam  going on.\",\"Wow where do I begin, I've recently experienced probably one of the worst customer service experiences ever.\",\"First class greater ambellio is actually a joke. I have travelled from ipswich to torquay. First western first class was amazing! The 1st  leg was massively disappointing. No difference to standard seats or facilities\",\"Purchased an interrail global pass for the both of us, having realised you can now use interrail on Eurostar, so I decided to look into booking some reduced price tickets, only to realise you need to call the customer service line and book with an agent, which i thought was a bit 1994. They don't pick up the phone after being on hold for several hours over a 3 day period. I decided to book tickets at the full price as i could'nt get to an agent to book me on with interrail discount. I eventually got hold of someone who I thought was rather cold and abrupt when i asked her to refund me my tickets and rebook me with my interrail pass discount, she would'nt help me out whatsoever, even though i had said i could'nt get hold of anyone as i was on hold for hours over 3 days.  Shocking customer service, but i suppose when a company has the monopoly of running international rail services, customer service does'nt come into it. In my experience, when everything works on Eurostar, its a pleasure. But when it goes wrong, the old chesnut of bad customer service rears its head. I remember a few years ago, we slowed down at Dollands Moor and stopped just outside the channel tunnel for 75 minutes, with no explanation given for the delay. We are not idiots, tell us there is a failed train infront of us or a points failure.\",\"Words can't even describe how incompetent this company is!!\",\"New  east coast web site is very poor -they have stopped sending email confirmations with booking code to get tickets. I worked out how to get the calander from my account but the booking reference in the calender entry is not the booking code for tickets!\",\"Having traveled with Eurostar for more than 5 years, their customer service has badly worsen over the years.\",\"Was the first ride.

I speak for myself only, Virgin Train won't get a single quid from in the future.\",\"Totally unacceptable, i have emailed Eurostar twice in past 2 weeks and rang them. No response from email and no answer on the telephone.  I have a serious complaint about extremely noisy and disruptive behaviour on their train... to make about my journey back from Brussels to London.  Very poor indeed.  UPDATE, after a public response on here from Eurostar themselves, informing me they will be in contact shortly...STILL NOT A WORD FROM THEM.\",\"Very clever pricing\",\"i have a life threatening nut allergy . i thought selling of peanuts on transport would be a thing of the past since even airborne nuts smell can make me vomit .

My operator of choice. Far better than my local service.\",\"Our trip was from St Pancras to Marseille.\",\"Ridiculous and irritating customer service. I tried to book two train tickets from London to Paris 10days ago. Error page popped up after I entered the credit card details. I didn't get to the page saying successful transaction and I didn't receive any confirmation email either. I called my bank and they said the money had been charged. Then I emailed them, no words back over the ten days and I called a few times, just long waiting with annoying music. What is the hotline for if there is no one picking up calls? I am still GBP 115 out of pocket. And it is so rude that no one from the company offers any help or support or even an answer.\",\"embarrassing company and extremely overpriced for the quality of service.\",\"I buy a first class ticket to get a first class service. Sometimes  this is non existent  with  no beverages  or food being available. It is part if the service most the time and this encourages me to purchase a first  class ticket  when on business. When it is not available it is  so annoying and complaints have been raised. My argument is if Virgin can't offer a full first  class service then we should be able to switch  to a second class ticket  and refund the difference. Is this not a fair option. I could  save money doing this and at least  know im only going to get a seat with nothing else.\",\"I would like to praise Virgin East Coat Trains for the way they treated me.\",\"Booked 1st class tickets for my wife and I Newcastle to London. Stewart took dinner order. After 2 hours no food. I complained then the steward said its coming. Never did when I complained just before arriving the steward said we have had no chef on the train you should have opted for sandwiches! Made a formal complaint but had to harras for a response. After 2 months  eventually got a response which said food is complimentary in 1st class and not part of the ticket price! Completely ignoring the fact that we had not had any food for more that 4 hours but had been led to believe it was on its way. Abmsmal customer service come back North East Coast operator 100% better than Virgin. They should have their licence suspended\",\"Unfortunately, I have had to use them since September 2017 weekly. Punctuality is very poor: usually just under 30 minutes late. Although, asked for a delay repayment for a 50  minute delay 3 weeks ago, the form has disappeared. Was over an hour late yesterday with no seat: I think they cancelled my train to save cost after we waited on the platform at Doncaster for an hour or so yesterday evening(5/11/17). The don't pick up the phone (15 mins and counting(18.55 6/11/17). The loo's are variable. Today(12/11/17) stuck in doncaster 45 mins.

Still no news on first claim over 3 weeks ago.\",\"Don't travel on there trains at weekends because they over book them and you can not get a seat even if you have reserved one!!!this happened to us from a train from Scotland to London on a Sunday we ended up having to stand for over 1 hour outside the train toilet!!.The Virgin on train staff  advised that due to tech issues and Rugby matches and people on the train from cross country should not been on.SO they blamed everyone else but themselves !!!!.\",\"Tried to book via an ipad, but process failed as the verified by VISA page as the site didnt seem to account for the scrolling required to fill in this box with all the details. Clicked back and re-booked with another card only to discover that the dates had reverted to a previous date for the outbound so I'm now left with paying the fee's to change the dates. As others have commented charging \\u00a330 admin fee per person per leg is not representative of the actual cost to change this especially with bookings made months in advance and is just sheer profiteering!\",\"I travelled to York the other day and when did Virgin Rail decide to stop giving you free tea or coffee in First Class? Really poor service. I expect more when I pay for First Class Tickets. I was travelling with a family member who's disabled so I was unable to leave my seat. I would have thought Virgin would look after their customers better, especially those with disabilities. I feel its more about cutting their service to increase their profit margins, than putting their customers first and giving them a first class customer experience.\",\"Does anyone ever get a refund from this company? Three trips by vtec and all three either delayed, disrupted or cancelled. Four months and twenty seven emails later nothing. One excuse after another. The train that died then came back to life and was only 29 minutes late is a classic.must have gone very fast, and empty, to make up the lost hour! In this day and age I would have thought a simple refund to the credit card that bought the tickets, but nothing is that simple.\",\"I have just had the pleasure of meeting the rudest member of staff at Londons Kings Cross/St Pancreas Premier check in. After panicking all the way here after having trains cancelled or delayed we made it with 40 mins to spare so thought we should just about make it. Until we met their horrendous member of staff. She complained to us that we were late and that we might not get in. So I was panicking and said 'ok lets try the gate' she replied by saying that if I was going to be like that I had to go to the ticket office and then would not give my tickets back when I asked her. I then tried to take them back and she snatched them away and told me not to snatch... my own tickets. She then started swearing in french. I eventually had to speak to a less irrational member of staff which seemed to change the womans mind and she gave our tickets back. The whole time she complained that she had been working since 4am and that people were late and rude to her. She obviously shouldn't be working in a customer based job. Horrendous customer service and would rather swim the channel than use Eurostar again.\",\"Definitely one of the better train lines. Service can differ but there are some really great personalities that work the trollies. The customer service following delay repay claims are also far better than I have found when compared to other train lines.\",\"Travelled 6th Jan Newcastle to Edinburgh return and it was perfect trains spot on time staff helpfull well done\",\"I travelled to London from Manchester and the service was exceptional, the staff Carole , Steve and Gail couldn't do enough for us .\",\"Filthy, old first class carriages with no trolley service both ways. This company needs to learn the real first class experience from a well know east coast operator.\",\"We had a comfortable return journey from Warwick Parkway to London, all to time, all as one would hope. The ticket office staff at Warwick Parkway are always helpful and friendly. However I seem to think that weekend fares now have much fewer advance purchase bargains. And I do think it was a big mistake for Chiltern to effectively withdraw their service into Stratford / Stratford Parkway which must make RSC theatre visits a real trial for many not living close by - very shortsighted.\",\"Poor response,in fact no response for 2 months to a delay repay claim. Fares have increased sharply since Virgin took over . Service in first class varies from good to not so good. Overall first class now very expensive for what you get. Quite coaches being removed in first class. Bad idea. Not every one wants to listen to other peoples  mobile phone calls on the train. It is a real pity East Coast trains were refranchised.\",\"Only use as i have no choice. Very poor service when you need to arrange a complaint / refund.

I used to live in Berwick upon Tweed and was basically driven out of the town because the trains are so unreliable and so expensive. For a journey of 45 minutes  from Berwick to Newcastle the open return now costs \\u00a329 and at weekends there are never any cheaper advance fares available, so a shopping trip to Newcastle has become prohibitively expensive. I have repeatedly missed appointments because of broken down trains, failed overhead lines, etc. During the recent snow the line north of Newcastle was blocked for days, and while I accept this is the responsibility of Network Rail, what really makes me angry is that Virgin's response to this is to issue a blanket announcement, 'Do not travel'. No attempt to provide details of where exactly the problems are and how to get round them. Every day just, don't travel.  I am delighted that Virgin has abandoned the east coast franchise and would like to see it re-nationalised, but I am so angry about the way they have scammed the taxpayer.\",\"never had a bad journey on virgin trains and i use them a lot, if you go on the trainline.com a few weeks before your journey you can always find bargain offers on trains.

I sent the ticket  (luckily) by recorded delivery. After 2 weeks again no sign of refund. Upon contact they denied to receive any ticket but when i chased up the recorded delivery reference they admitted they had recieved it the next day i sent the ticket.

I was due to travel over the weekend but unfortunately spent Friday in hospital and now have limited mobility meaning I couldn't travel. The advertised claim of 'change time/ date of tickets for just \\u00a330' is misleading, it actually cost me \\u00a3164 to change tickets for me and my friend. Customer service were no help after I was direct to them via the online chat service (who assured me they could help) and said as it's my fault I couldn't travel not theirs it was right that I should pay. Should I have realised changing tickets would have cost as much as two new tickets I would have flown instead. Deeply regret using this company and will definitely not make the same mistake again\",\"We use East Midlands Trains on a regular basis, the service is always brilliant and if we do get stuck their Twitter team comes back quick.\",\"The call centre staff are more than  rubbish to deal with. They have no idea on what their talking about and give you the run around\",\"My wife and I travelled from Paris to London on 14th April 2018. We were both impressed. The staff at Paris were extremely busy due to this being in the middle of the union strikes in Paris but were pleasant and helpful in every respect. The train itself was clean, comfortable and again the staff on board pleasant and engaging. The negatives: Paris Gare du Nord is not set up properly for Eurostar. The queuing system is a shambles but I'm sure this is due to lack of space. One or two more staff would ease the problems of group bookings just pushing through lines that have been halted due to congestion and more money needs to be invested into the customs process.(this is no fault of Eurostar ). If you are travelling standard or premium standard be prepared to queue and re queue and allow yourself plenty of time. Even with these negatives we found it a totally enjoyable experience.\",\"Normally Eurostar is OK, I use them about 10 times per year and things generally work (even at the notorious Paris terminal).  But they have really struggled with managing the impact of the SNCF strikes in April.  I have had three sets of reservations cancelled because of this, but couldn't change them on line (other than for extortionate prices, even though the advice page claimed I could change them for free) nor get through to their call centre to change them at all over many attempts.  This meant I could not be sure of travelling on any particular train back from Dresden via Brussels to London so I went by plane instead.  You should be aware that, if you do make a booking with Eurostar, the most they will give you back in such a situation is the fare paid with no compensation.  When I did get through to the call centre (about 10 days after I got back), there was no question of a compensation ticket for another time because their 'policy when things go wrong' has been watered down.  Because I had booked sometime in advance, the fare paid was nowhere what it actually cost to get back that day (8th April).  It was a poor experience all round, even BA managed better last May during their power outage.  My advice:  don't make ANY bookings with them whilst the strikes continue, you will be left on your own if the train is cancelled!!!\",\"I use the app daily, I just wish that the app would reflect when the trains get canned and go from another station\",\"My daughter paid for first class for her return journey after flying from Florida.  Got on the train at St Pancras and there was only water on offer.  No tea, no coffee, no snacks. She was so hungry and was desperate for a cup of tea! Absolutely appalling. Travelling on her own, she couldn't leave her things to go in search of a buffet car.  They take the first class fare but do not offer the service.  How do they get away with this? We went first class with Virgin trains and it was absolutely fantastic.  At service food and drinks and the first class lounge for the return journey was  wonderful with ample food and drinks available and on the journey itself we had sandwiches, biscuits, drinks etc.\",\"This company is my daily trip to the office.

Its an expensive journey this route anyway and if I cannot get any work done I may as well go by car. I will be doing exactly that from next week, or go via Newport on Arriva.

On board I went to seek the food and beverage cart to be met by a member of staff called \\\"Jon\\\" (10:04am to Bournemouth) who was extremely rude and nasty who laughed when I said I had a quench of thirst. He wouldn't serve me dispite his cart was full. He would only serve me in the aisle, this I don't mind but when I explained the train is packed and he would be a while he said \\\"well well well either move or simply wait\\\" move yes but on a packed train? Simply wait yes but am I not entitled to purchase a drink as a paying customer (\\u00a3126:00). As I said I had already been to the other cart at the other side of train and it wasn't open his response was \\\"get over it\\\" Iam disgusted at this poor attitude! I will be taking this matter further due to the derogatory comments he also spoke but I didn't want to post on public as children read. I feel I needed to share this.\",\"I travelled from London to Brussels and the service was horrible in Standard Premier with rude on board staff. Not to mention the mismanaged boarding procedures at St. Pancras where the train arrives on the platform just 5 mins before departure.  Next time I will take a plane or try the Dutch Flyer service instead. Definitely avoid this option.\",\"Again, i seem to be running against the tide here when I compliment Virgin Trains (West Coast). I regularly catch the train from Stafford to Euston and have enjoyed superb service and punctuality. The booking and seat allocation are always easy to do via the web and picking up the tickets at the station before you travel is simplicity itself. Well done Virgin Trains\",\"Use Virgin often as back and forth to Manchester.

Although I'm a mature student, fallowing the company law, in order to have a discount card the university have to stamp the application form. ( which I had) one of the their member of staff said right on my face that as a mature student she thinks that I should not be allowed any discount card. How dare this women talks to customers like that? If I was applying for the card is because I was entitle to do so! And who is she to tell me otherwise? I used to love virgin company but their lack of politeness and rude staffs are letting the company down. Not acceptable.\",\"Had the worst experience with Eurostar this morning.

The attitude was so positive, and in the end the assistance was sorted. She also said that the care on her inward  journey ( also not organised) was also excellent. So a big thank you for that 'how can we help?' attitude. It was very much appreciated, especially as we were at fault for not organising ourselves sooner.\",\"Currently travelling to Edinburgh. 1st class lounge coffee machine out of order. No toast offered. Breakfast food quality very low and degrading over previous visits, almost inedible. Sausage not cooked, pink meat/ raw pork. One cup of coffee offered in 1.5 hours. Staff focussed on clean-up vs service\",\"virgin trains website is a mess !\",\"I was queuing at the security thing with my luggage and a large Costa Americano. I was concerned that I would not be able to take my recently purchased, piping hot and much loved coffee through security. However a very kind gentleman named Charlie Macauley allowed me to take the coffee through, and even provided a coffee holder to take the coffee through the security scanner without spilling. He was great banter and a very kind man. He also wished me a happy holiday. Eurostar, please give this man a payrise. Because of him we will most certainly be using Eurostar again, and recommending it to friends. Excellent customer service. Well done and thank you Macauley!\",\"To begin. I had bought tickets via the Train Line booking service to travel to Edinburgh from London Kings Cross. Normally I'm usually on the ball with these things and printed out my tickets at home. Day of departure and arrive in plenty of time to have a coffee. Sitting in the station concourse it suddenly occurred that my print outs were not the actual tickets needed to travel. In a panic I headed for the booking office where I was informed that I had to contact The Train Line. At this point I had about 15 minutes to departure. The booking assistant gave me a number to call and advised that I should get them to fax details over to them at Kings Cross. After a very tense time listening to the usual recorded options that pass for exceptional customer service, I managed to get them to fax over my booking. Remember I did have a print out proving my reservation and seat. Rushing back to the counter the man I saw couldn't have cared less.\",\"As soon as Virgin took over ticket prices for my normal route rose from \\u00a350 to \\u00a3150 - a whopping increase, making the journey unaffordable for me.   They spend vast sums of money on stupid irritating adverts plastered all over the place, rather than providing a decent affordable service.   Not everyone can book 6 months in advance (even though the price of advance tickets has even risen considerably since 2015) and many if not most have to travel last minute.  Its outrageous that you can end up paying 200-300% more than someone else for the same journey.  Everyone should have access to reasonably priced tickets at all times like everywhere else in Europe.  Virgin and the whole rail system in the UK is a disgrace.\",\"Appalling Website and Rip off Loyalty schemes.  No customer focus\",\"First class poor standards of customer care, they just don't get it.\",\"Do you read all the reviews? This company has one of the worst ratings of all! I travelled for the first time today and before your pathetic defence of it being a bank holiday - I wish I had gone back to Heathrow even after the fiasco of yesterday's cancellations. It was literally a stampede at Kings X when the platform was announced only to find that EVERY seat was reserved, creating havoc as people crammed the train but could not sit down as only a handful of passengers had actually reserved seats. Why we're all the seats showing a reservation if they weren't?\",\"I have recently travelled by Virgin east coast train to Edinburgh. I had the ticket for 7pm, however, I am not able to get on the train as it was overcrowded, so it was not possible to stand even. Me and my friend were advised to take the next train at 7.30pm, so we headed back to the gates. However, I have spotted that one of the 1st class carriages was not completely full, so we have asked whether we could possibly get on the train in that carriage, so he confirmed and let us in. Luckily, we managed to find 2 seats, which seemed reserved, but none actually came in during the whole journey. As we had standard ticket, the ticket inspector asked us to upgrade to 1st class which was \\u00a3120 per person, so we did not have any options, but to pay. We were told that they might have run out of meals so had the remind them at least 5 times to check whether there was any food left. At the end, we got our meal, however, we were not given a desert with the excuse that the train was full and they can not pass through, and all of their staff looked angry and acted impolitely. Overall, terrible experience.\",\"Here's a complaint letter I wrote to Virgin today:\",\"Poorly organised . Rat race with no management or care .\",\"Queued for over 2 hours at Gare de Nord station.  No Eurostar staff to tell us why, no water handed out, nowhere to sit etc.  Once checked in we had to board immediately, no time to get something to eat or drink (unless you want to buy something on the train, which I would advise you avoid).  Customer services failed to address my complaint - volume of people when you presell tickets is NOT a valid excise nor is it the reason there were no staff to inform people or the excuse to treat people so badly.  Would NEVER chose to travel by Eurostar again, I'd prefer to spend my time travelling to an airport!\",\"It was relatively easy to book our First Class round trip tickets from London King Cross to Edinburgh,\",\"Nilesh  very helpful in helping us with quite a serious problem.\",\"I have to travel with Eurostar because I am French and work in London so I have have more than 10 years experience in taking the Eurostar at least monthly. THEY HAVE THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!\",\"I went on the Virgin Trains East Coast website today, in order to book a trip to Edinburgh in November.\",\"Travelling on Virgin First Class between Crewe and London.  Old carriage pretty full with only one service person.  The reason I am leaving this five star feedback is because of him.  I am sitting at the back and have watched him serve for the past hour non stop.

Give him a training role please !\",\"No platform for train displayed on Kings Cross notice board and only caught the train because we overheard someone saying the platform number. All the Virgin staff at Kings Cross said was to wait for the platform number to be displayed. If we had done that, we would still be waiting for it. Useless, unhelpful and ignorant staff who are supposed to be working for a flagship company who's boss lives the life or riley in the Carribean and doesn't give a flying fig about you or me.\",\"For 2nd time in a month I have been on a failed train. Right now I have been stranded on a hot train, no aircon near Peterborough for over 3 hrs. The device that feeds electricity from the overheads completely failed in a series of bangs and flashes, causing the train to grind to a halt.\",\"Neither EuroDespatch nor Eurostar wish to carry bikes / so beware! You can only take your bike on trains to Paris , Lille and Brussels - that's all. ( forget about going to Calais etc .. they aren't interested). There are many restrictions and contacting them is difficult. You have to buy the passenger rail ticket first with Eurostar  - then contact a second company called EuroDespatch to book your bike ( hoping that there is space for the bike on the same train ). My email was answered after 12 days .. and I phoned EuroDespatch dozens of times on their published number - and it was never answered. Totally hopeless. I sincerely hope the management are all sacked.\",\"This company is ridiculous. My company paid a 1st class weekly pass for me to travel from Birmingham to London everyday as I am 8.5 months pregnant. Within this week not even 1 train was on time and I mean with serious delays of more than 20-30 min each time. Today, I even had to stand for half an hour (and Iam heavily pregnant as I mentioned earlier) because many trains were delayed and they had to put everyone in the same train. So basically I did not sit for half an hour, did not get a compensation for my travel because I had a weekly pass and was not given even an apology. Discrase.\",\"I booked a ticket on the website and requested a refund on the my account section on the same day before the payment was taken. They charged me anyway and didn't reply to my request for a refund, nor is there any information on the website with a status update. So I decided to get a reply I'd have to call them, and I could write an essay on why this is the worst customer phone lines I've ever used. The 'web support' team in Edinburgh don't answer their phone ever it seems. So I call back to the sales team who surprise surprise answered quite quickly. They recommended I call the customer complaints number instead, so I tried that and I've now been on the phone for 30 minutes with no sign of an answer. This company is a disgrace and should never have taken the franchise off East Coast who were state run. If there's ever been a better example of why privatisation of the rail network was a terrible idea this is it. Where is the customer service, the supposedly 'innovative' private sector? You can't even answer a phone to a customer with a legitimate complaint. I'll be trying every other option in future rather than get on one of virgins trains. Richard Branson and the whole company should be ashamed of themselves. You're not doing the bare minimum to keep a franchise, you're doing less and I hope for the public's sake you lose it very soon.\",\"Not First Class by any stretch of the imagination:\",\"Obviously a great technological achievement, Eurostar is let down by its awful customer service (as a regular customer, I faced problems time and time again and the lack of communication is astounding) and its very high prices. They're also trying to sell you a \\\"long haul flight\\\" experience with on board entertainment via wifi, but don't be fooled: the wifi NEVER works.\",\"Again using ancient East Midlands trains on the Leeds - Kings X route. No seat reservations, very noisy. Customer Service is a joke. The train service taints the entire Virgin brand.\",\"Trying to receive refund for change of journey despite speaking to two representatives, completing enquiry on line and completing complaint on line I am still waiting this is alongside the time wasted holding to be put through no wonder always experiencing high volume of calls presumably all complaints !!\",\"Customer helpline is actually an oxymoron: they don't help customers at all, in the slightest. At time of writing this, am sat on the phone (and have been for 14 minutes) with some pseudo-Geordie annoying voice telling me they be with me as soon as they can. Virgin, please define 'soon', because in my world, the real world, sat listening to your excuses for 13 minutes doesn't pass as 'soon.'\",\"Paid extra to travel 1st Class, table was dirty and no food available (despite menu being on table). I complained to Virgin and in the email reply that took 2 weeks to receive was told the food was 'complimentary' and was not included in the ticket price.... i.e. I was basically being told it was tough that they had no breakfast or sandwiches buy they didn't have to supply food, if you get it count yourself lucky !  This is the second time this has happened to me with Virgin East Coast. In the earlier days with them this sort of thing didn't happen. All I can say is bring back GNER !\",\"The new website is a disaster for customers. It seems to have been purposefully desgined to be awkward, difficut and horrible to use to ensure no one ever uses it. I shall only use trainline from now on. I have tried twice now to change a ticket and get a refund on the ticket I can no longer use and had to re-verify my account twice, once I was already in my account and then found out it would take 48 hours for the ticket I was trying to change to show up..or something. I lost the will to live trying to figure out how I could get my ten quid back. it used to be simple and elegant to change a ticket. I hope that the extra money they are making is worth it to Virgin for the totally abysmal customer relations they are fostering.\",\"I even contacted the CEO much obfuscation  over a statutory refund of 140 POUNDS which was due us from 12th April 2016. You end up going to the regulator to sort out your rights. I imagine having to go to law and then eventually find the Sheriffs have to serve them notice at their head office. I was astounded by the amount of bad press on trust pilot from customers until I started using them.\",\"I have used Eurostar regularly in the past but have not travelled on it for a couple of years.

I was trying to book online, and after I've put all my card details, every time I pressed pay now, the quoted ticket price was going up by \\u00a340! They claimed that tickets in this price sold out (even though there were 9 tickets available at this price). After deleting cookies, the old price came back. I tried to book on my phone, other browser etc, and every time the price went up by \\u00a340! So they show you one pricing grid and try to scam you when you're ready to book by saying that the tickets sold out (when they clearly didn't).\",\"I travelled with eurostar on 26th December. I called before regarding special assistance as my son is autistic and large crowds/queues etc cause high anxiety and stress and causes him to vomit amongst other things. I was told to arrive 90minutes early and go to the assistance desk and we would be helped. I did this and also took proof of my sons issues with me. The man took one look at my husband and I our 3 suitcases, our 7 year old son, our 2 year old daughter an practically laughed. He said you have him with you to help with children and bags why are you here?\",\"Update 11/03: Eurostar finally agreed to take into account points earned from trips made before the introduction of Club Eurostar. However Eurostar will not re-calculate status points from previous trips using the new system, it will just consider the status points earned under the previous scheme. This is unfair because status points under the previous scheme were harder to accrue but the point threshold to reach Carte Blanche status was much lower.\",\"Early mornings or rush hours tend to be the most packed as many people are commuting to their daily activities. Most of the time, the trains are short in carriages making the morning travels even more packed. Booking a seat is pointless when you cannot even get to your seat. How can I get to my seat when I have a train to catch to catch this train? By the time I arrive many people have already come on board\",\"A redacted version of the email I've just sent to Transport Focus:\",\"Awful customer service.

Our bus was late picking us up and late arriving at Parkway. We hurried to the platform only to be told the train doors were shut and we couldn't get on. We watched as our booked train left, and had to wait an hour for the next one, not knowing if we would even get s seat. What part of \\\"replacement\\\"  does Cross Country not understand? Why couldn't the train wait for the scheduled bus? Terrible service.\",\"Had a fire on engine in 1st class carriage tonight (April 4, 2018) when travelling from Yorkshire to Southampton. All staff rushed customers to move to another carriage after fire alarm. I travel with a baby, pushchair and some bags, including shopping bag with some groceries. They asked everyone to board off in Burton, brought my pushchair, pushchair\\u2019s basket and one of the bags to the entrance of the next carriage but... not the grocery bag. Is CC staff hungry?\",\"Useless insurance. It is not what it seems to be. Received an email saying Relax your covered while in reality they cover very limited cases. Check their WORDING. Absolutely useless all the credit cards have an insurance like this included, no body need this. Customer care rude and unhelpful.\",\"We were due to go to Disneyland Paris via Lille on Monday 14th May. At the time of booking we did not know about the train strikes in France. The day before we where due to leave I got a email from the French train network. Most of it was in French, understandably, so I didn't understand it but I managed to work out that it said that our connecting train in Lille had been cancelled. I phoned Eurostar, who had made no attempt to tell me this, who said it had not been cancelled. I checked the French train network website which reported that it had been cancelled. I phoned back again and this time they admitted they had made a mistake and the connection had been cancelled. If I had not checked myself then I could have been stranded in Lille with my 2 year old son on the word of a Eurostar customer services call handler. Appalled! Will never use Eurostar again!\",\"just OK summer will be busy\",\"I paid \\u00a3130.00 to stand outside a toilet from Darlington to London.  Apart from the sheer theft, what impression are we giving to our tourists who are sitting on vestibule floors?

Further to my negative review 3 days ago Eurostar's response is below, very dissappointing, gone are the days when they'd offer a free ticket unconditionally. Good will out of the window. This cuts both ways. I shall now use them as a last resort and make others aware of their poor standards:\",\"The air conditioning was broken on my outward journey. According to the attendant it had been broken for some time and he wasn't very pleased that it hadn't been fixed yet despite his pleas to higher powers for this to happen. I endured a very uncomfortable night during which I was either very hot or, having taken the covers off me and after the temperature had dropped, very cold. I woke up in the morning with a sore throat and hoarseness, and my voice hasn't recovered even now, 10 days later. I can only think that the reason it wasn't fixed in a timely manner has something to do with the fact that the trains are soon to be replaced. On one leg of the only other journey I have made with Caledonian sleeper, there was a problem with the ventilation which meant we had to sleep with the doors open to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning. Presumably some suit in an office somewhere decided it would be a shrewd business move to spend money on advertising the new fleet of trains, rather then rushing to ensure that customers have a comfortable journey in existing trains that will soon go out of use. No refund was offered for the lack of air conditioning.\",\"Around 5 years ago I bought a train ticket online from Virgin East Coast simply because they operated the route I needed to use to get from A to B.\",\"The poorest customer service I have ever experienced. Around Christmas 2017 a female instructor insisted I spent \\u00a335 on a new ticket from Sheffield to Nottingham even though I could clearly evidence I had purchased a specified ticket for the train I was travelling on. She was rude, disparaging and aggressive in front of other passengers with no appreciation that other passengers could hear her shouting at me. To top it it off when I complained they never provided a refund even though, again, I had confirmation of my purchase. Absolutely vile company, which I will continue to boycott through using other train services and booking tickets through alternative company sites. They should be ashamed to have workers like this representing their company.\",\"Terrible service and customer service . our train was canceled , we were not informed so we had to wait , so we arrived at Birmingham late and missed our connecting train to wales and had to wait 2 hours . myself with 2 children , and no seats as our seats we had preboooked were canceled , very disappointing .so our 5 hour train journey was 7 1/2 hours\",\"A very poor service on the Chester to Manchester train, overcrowded to an unacceptable level at peak times.

traveled with them recently and although I bookded well in advance I had to stand all the way from Birmingham to London after a full day at the fair! Just imagine that.\",\"I have sent two emails to you but you have chosen to ignore me, it's very typical of your Company from my experience, I do hope that I do not have to utilize your services again.\",\"My comment is about using compensation vouchers.  My husband travels to London on the train quite a lot but was delayed in the summer.  He was duly sent \\u00a332.50 in vouchers - hardly compensation - more a con to use Virgin again.  Anyway the vouchers cannot be used on online bookings, you have to call a number or go to your nearest staton to book.  Hardly customer friendly.  Fares are more expensive booking this way and you cannot claim Nectar points as you can online - and at \\u00a3220 thats a few! Then there is a huge palava of writing a letter and sending the vouchers in at least 10 working days before you travel.  They then call you to taken payment balance.  Sorry Virgin - customer service is a joke.  How many people just go 'oh I cant be bothered' and you have paid out no compensation at all!!!!  Thats why you make so much money!\",\"The customer service man was extremely unhelpful.  We bought my sons fianc\\u00e9 who is a student, a ticket on line with our payment card as a treat so she could visit and didn't think about her having to have the card with her to collect the tickets.  The man said that there was nothing that could be done and she would have to purchase another ticket - surely NR can do something in these situations rather than take \\u00a370 of our money for nothing!!  Disgusting!  The unhelpful rude man didn't even give us any clear advice.\",\"My partner and I traveled for his birthday on Virgin from London to York and back.  The trains were late on both journeys -- just as they were dirty.  On the return trip, our carriage simply did not exist.  We had to squeeze between a crowd of passengers fighting for seats.  Extremely disappointing.\",\"We have just travelled from Edinburgh to Newark Northgate, the train stopped for no more than 20seconds then closed the doors and pulled off\",\"Yesterday the 2nd January my Son and his partner were due to catch the 9.15 from Berwick on Tweed to London, this was cancelled so was the 10.15, they eventually caught a train after 11am. Had to sit on the floor until York, This really is appalling service. It has happened so many times since Virgin took over this line. The cost of the tickets have risen considerably but not service. Richard Branson should be ashamed of this line. Instead of being home at lunch time they arrived at 5pm!\",\"Booked a train at the start of Jan and was charged twice by Virgin Trains website. Complained several times via email but only received automated responses. 2 months later I finally hear from them but only to say that this is a Virgin East Coast issue not a Virgin Trains issue and that I need to contact them directly as it is a separate company. Absolutely appalling customer service.\",\"This company must have the worst customer service I have ever come across. My wife has a medical condition that means she cannot sit with strangers. Virgin chose seats that were not together, and I of course requested a full refund. They then said that a \\u00a310 refund fee would be charged unless I produced some form of medical evidence that her condition existed!! All this for \\u00a310.  Add to this the fact that a doctor's note would cost the same amount and the cost of a 90 minute phone call and you can see why I think their so called 'customer service' is virtually non-existent.\",\"My teenage daughter in early December went to Newcastle via York from Scarborough for an One Day as a potential new student for Newcastle University in the academic year starting September 2016. A simple journey made a nightmare by Network Rail and 3rd party train company breaking down at an intersection of the main East Coast line outside Darlington.\",\"I have traveled back from France a few weeks ago.. and it was a new train which I thought cool it is going to be more comfortable.. but apart the nicer look and more space for my long legs.. It is not comfortable at all.. I miss the heat things on the side that really help you to sleep in peace, the seats are hard and to be honest I prefer the older ones.\",\"As other reviews have said, the change from East Coast to Virgin has not been a good one.  The staff on the Inverness - Edinburgh line continue to be excellent but Virgin has raised prices, done away with the rewards scheme and ignores emails.  I am trying to get the Delay Repay compensation but, after numerous emails with no reply, I doubt that I will get it.  Why offer this scheme if you are not willing to honour it?\",\"Since Virgin took over the east coast contract they have managed to turn a barely excepable service into a terrible one.\",\"130 for a return fare to Newcastle:\",\"I reserved a seat in the quiet coach with a table and next to a power socket as I had a lot of urgent work to be getting on with.  The air conditioning in the quiet coach was broken.  After 2 minutes in the coach I was unable to take the heat any longer (the coach had evidently been sitting in the sun for quite a while it must have been a good 35+ degrees).  Therefore I had to move to another coach, which was noisy, with no power socket or table.  I asked for a refund as I did not obtain what I paid for.  After over 8weeks I received a train voucher, which did not even cover the cost of my original ticket.  Obviously they do this because it is cheaper for them, but as consumers we have the right to obtain a full refund if we buy something which is not fit for purpose.

Unfortunately we got there about 6.25, still 25 mins left to catch the train and it was not busy hours. staff there didn't let us through and each staff kept asking us to see a different staff and no one was a help and they were arrogant and aggressive, it was a disappointment that we have enough time and they were dragging us along. each one of us end up paying extra to catch the next train. we sit there for our next train and the boarding only started 15 mins before the departure. we see people walking in 5 mins before the departure to other trains and we feel that we were picked on and it was unfair.

I was told no discount would be given even though I have a valid government card.

At times I thought I was back in the 80's inter railing in rural Greece but then I realised it was more like a Michael Palin trip through deepest India, I was staggered that there were not people clinging to the outside of the carriages.

When we got to the station in Manchester, we asked one of the Virgin Trains employees to look at our e-ticket and tell us where to go and they pointed to one of the trains and told us to go there. We got on the train and were approached by one of their employees who asked for our tickets and ended up charging us (again!) 85 GBP because we accidentally got on a train that was 10 minutes earlier (even though we were directed to it by other Virgin Trains employees!). On top of it all, the employee was extremely rude and when we tried to explain the situation which caused our confusion, he threatened us that he'd involve the police.

No call from manager after 3 to 4 days so called back. This time told the following: they would need to check tickets had been returned that call-backs from a manager would be within next 4 hours and that I there was every possibility that credit would be within next 2 to 3 days.

Was looking forward to a peaceful journey when all passengers were interrupted by the conductor arguing unfairly with two tourists who had gotten on the wrong train. The outcome was he refunded one friend and the other friend had to pay. They had gotten a train 20 minutes earlier by accident as they never realised that there were two different trains. They were treated so unfairly and this should not happen to anyone. My mum and I had gotten a train before hand and were told we could catch any train at any time as long as we had the tickets yet they were told differently and completely humiliated.\",\"Virgin basically let us cook on a train for a 4 hour journey with no air conditioning.

Instead, I was forced to buy a new single way ticket for 82 pounds. This being my first time in England using the train, I felt very taken advantage of. I thought the service of the train was great, but unfortunately I do not think I would use it for my future travels because of the lack of understanding and flexibility on the part of the train line.\",\"Busted seat no reservations and limited catering   Did get a tea that was clearly made in Newcastle I got on at Newark.

You have to call Virgin to redeem them and then you have to send the voucher by special delivery to their Edinburgh office and they post you the tickets.  I had all of my details pre-prepared and rang to book 4 journeys.  Their call centre is in India so it wasn't clear that the staff had fully understood what I'd booked so I checked the booking and one return journey had been made for the wrong month.  I rang them back and they advised me that I had to wait 72 hours before they could check the phone call recording and make sure the error was theirs and not mine.  As one of the booked journeys was only 2 weeks away I sent the voucher to Edinburgh with a letter clearly explaining that one of the bookings attached to the reference number was incorrect.  Three days later I received all of the tickets including those for the incorrect train journey.  Did no-one bother to read the letter?  I have had to ring the call centre a third time and ask why no-one has got back to me about the incorrect  booking.  They checked the booking and said there was a note to say it was their error and they agreed to re-book it for the correct dates.  I had to pay for the new booking and send the wrong tickets back to Edinburgh and await a refund.  So, they compensate me for a delayed train and then I have to spend hours on the phone and writing letters and pay \\u00a36 for special delivery twice and pay up front for a ticket that should be complimentary and then wait for a refund.\",\"Only printed the first half of the return journey from Edinburgh to London, the staff refused to do anything and I had to pay \\u00a3137 for a single to get back home.

The payment went through - it always does doesn't it - but the tickets could not be generated / downloaded. The message was 'Contact Customer Service'. As it was 1AM, I left it until the morning: surely they could resolve the website  glitch by then. In the morning, at the station - no tickets, same message. No phone number, no reference, 10 min before the train. Bought a regular ticket. Got to the Customer Service ~1 h later (you have to study the app to find contact numbers), explained what happened. No interest shown, was suggested to cancel the ticket for a standard  \\u00a310 fee (for  \\u00a315 ticket). Complained in writing. Was told off, twice. Still cannot understand what I have done wrong. Sure, a cozy monopoly on rail travel plus a third-world country customer service makes it a nice business model.

We realised this on the train to Gare De Lyon so we realised we had to change station. This was a nightmare, no one spoke English and all the signage was in French. After finally getting to Paris Nord and into the Eurostar queue we were told we were 3 minutes late to check in. Went to the ticket office who tried charging \\u00a340 each to be put on the next train which was  1 hour later. Explained to the staff that there was no way that we could have got from one station to the other due to our circumstances and language barriers any faster and having paid for premium tickets we thought that been 3 minutes late was very mean, especially with the price we paid. They refused to listen to anything we had to say, and tried to make it our own wrong doing. Once we were on the train all was well though, on time and friendly staff.

I didn't reserve a seat because on the train companies I usually use, this is either not possible or not necessary. Not so with Virgin: both trains I took were fully booked, which means that out of 8 or 10 carriages, there is a single one with non-reserved seats. This is obviously not enough for all the people who turn up without a reservation - either because they weren't aware that it is necessary or because they couldn't know in advance which train they would be able to take, or because they missed the one they had reserved seats on. (Virgin charges you for changing a reservation, apprently.) In consequence, I had to sit on the floor outside the toilet for 2 hours, with many fellow-sufferers.

One day between trains and a completely different experience in the second. The first journey provided great service tables set out, hot food choices, wine available as well as soft drinks and the staff couldn\\u2019t do enough for us. When we boarded for the second leg we were abruptly by one of the onboard staff members who firstly advised we were in the wrong place (I wasn\\u2019t as I booked and paid a fortune for anytime) and then rudely advised me that as I had boarded an earlier train than originally planned I wouldn\\u2019t have my pre reserved seats. I understood this but I paid a lot of money for anytime as I knew my plans were likely to change and did not expect such a rude response.  The next thing is the choice of a wrap (very nice if you like spicy food) my mum doesn\\u2019t or alternatively what equates to a cheese spread sandwich. We asked for a glass of wine with our food and were told that wine is not served on a weekend but we could purchase it from the bar!! Really?? We had it on a Friday and we could buy it from the baron we wanted alcohol so why not serve it within the extortionate price of a first class ticket???? This is ridiculous and certainly not consistent with the choices delivered on our journey the previous day. In the end after paying \\u00a3762.00 I went to the bar and paid extra for refreshments and hot food for this sector of our journey which takes almost 4 hours of our total trip.

What gives them the right to impose their prejudiced views on their customers? Well, my response will in future be to avoid using Virgin trains.\",\"Why are the people answering the phones at Eurostar so unhelpful and unwilling to do anything for their customers I will never understand, considering that\\u2019s their main job, is shocking how unhelpful some of them are. I am experiencing difficulties to sign in to my account to purchase train tickets, but got of the phone with a man by the name of Dom- and I just felt that he was not interested in helping, and just told me to keep trying to do the same things I told him I had already done but didn\\u2019t work, when asked if I could speak to someone else, he said no one else is available right now ... frustrating.\",\"If I could score less than 1 I would. This company doesn't have a clue about customer service. I complained about their website and the crass language used and received a standard response, not address any of the issues I raised.\",\"Unbelievable, not impressive and expensive. So I travelled with my family via Virgin from London to Birmingham. It cost more than the other carrier and so we expected a higher standard. We paid for a table and 4 seats with window view for our family for this long journey. Instead when we got on the train we had front facing seats, a blank wal that shielded our view,   no table  and NO STAFF TO ASSIST. We then observed people sitting anywhere they pleased despite the reserved seat signs. I am dusgusted! Needless to say I will not be travelling with Virgin again. Hopefully Richard Branson would get iff his island and tend to his business.POOR! POOR! POOR!\",\"I was about to board the 16:25 from Birmingham New street to Shrewsbury, my daily commute on 30/01/2018. As usual the train was disgustingly overfilled (a complaint for a separate occasion). Most carriages were filled right up to the doors. I noticed the final carriage had a fair amount of space by the rear doors as well as down the isle. Aware of this I was about to board (in a rush as there was only a minute left before the train departed) where a rather tall male conductor blocked my path and explained rather rudely that I could not board this section of the train as it was 'full' now I'm no expert in the physics of space in trains but compared to the other carriages this area was by far the emptiest, with there being enough space easily for another 15 people, I explained this to the conductor. But he was having none of it. Concerned by the lack of time i now had due to this rude arrogant man I had no choice now but to run off to somehow find another area with space for me to board. In my frustration of this incident, as I was walking off I shouted 'useless' to which the train manager I had just had my encounter with started screaming 'excuse me' .... 'EXCUSE ME' in my direction. I continued to run to another carriage where I could board, ignoring this man as I was concerned I would not get on the train and I didn't have time to deal with him again. At this point as I was midway between the end carriage he started to run after me. To which I then stopped in shear shock of this action. He then got within\",\"The only train service I have known to still charge for the WiFi.\",\"I travel on Eurostar almost weekly and frequently I need to change journey and/or ticket. I have constantly encountered poor customer service even after new web site went live. Now I need to change my next journey and the website keeps indicating that no trains run on the selected date. However, if I wanted to buy a new ticket for that same date the website would allow me to do so. As Carte Blanche member I have tried to get in touch with the dedicated telephone number for the last two days without success. No success with general customer service number either. I am growing increasingly frustrated and found myself to spend more on BA lately than on Eurostar. I forgot to mention that the the web chat had been equally unavailable any time I tried to connect to it. Please get your act together!\",\"Yesterday, I took the Eurostar from Paris Gare Ddu Nord to London: the French physiometric custom gates do not work, the staff of Eurostar and French customs do not care; customs officers are violent, harassing (get super close to you, push you, check your bag in all directions, ask you for your eurostar ticket that you have had three times checked by their friends !!!). Awful, rude, violent and horrendous experience. And the Eurostar staff in Paris: but what horror they are not involved in their work and the notion of good \\\"customer service\\\" is completely foreign to them. Cows.\",\"Appalling company! I have had reason to complain on more than one occasion for awful service. The latest complaint was by letter which has been ignored for several weeks now. Will not use this company again!\",\"Shocking experience in gare de nord on our way back to London. Clearly the set up is absolutely not capable of processing a large train load of people that turn up between half hour and an hour before the train is supposed to leave! Hundreds of people in mass queues taking 45 minutes to get through check in, then French passport control, then uk passport control, then security, then another queue waiting for boarding! Awful experience!\",\"Recent Eurostar experience has been a complete joke. Left London on a Friday morning train which was over 90 minutes late. Missed the meeting in Paris I was scheduled to go to. The departure area at st pancras was complete chaos and they stopped letting people through to prevent over crowding.\",\"I use the trains a lot and this must be the most appaling train comp in the country. The on board staff were fine but appeared to be struggling for infomation and to support their employers.\",\"I had a wonderful ride on a modern train to London.  So why two stars?  It was not the train I booked, and I had booked to go to Ashford.  The queues at Paris Gare du Nord were horrific.  My connecting train was delayed but I arrived at Gare du Nord with a good half an hour to check-in.  The queue to check-in took over 40 minutes.  And then had to wait another 40 minutes to find out with 5 minutes to go that I had been reassigned a seat in the next, modern train to London.  Something needs to be done about the Paris check-in.  It was also very poorly sign-posted.  But that new train was really comfortable.\",\"\\u0130f Eurostar cancel your trip because of weather conditions and you didn't print your tickets before they cancelled from Amsterdam to London and there is  no options for printing your ticket including Thalys ticket, but when you call Eurostar customer service, they say we canceled only Brussel to London and you can still get Thalys train but if they cancel your trip you cant access your Thalys ticket anymore on the Eurostar website and Eurostar's website say call customer service, customer service say go to Amsterdam Central station and pickup your Thalys ticket but there is no option to collect ticket because it dosent show on the system. Because they cancel your booking number and Thalys ticket under the this booking number because you booked through Eurostar web site. No one could get access to my Thalys ticket and print at Amsterdam station because of cancelled booking number. During a total of 90 minutes of calling time over 3 times with customers service they told me , i had to buy another ticket with Thalys get to Brussels. Why should I have to pay for another ticket when Eurostar canceled my Thalys ticket. Guys when you buy ticket from Eurostar you have to print immediately otherwise if they cancel and you didn't print your ticket before you can't access your Thalys ticket for print or download.\",\"Purchased a return ticket for a journey and paid for the tickets to be delivered. The journey was split with a change at Derby so I should have received four individual tickets for each leg of the journey, only received three. After contacting was informed that the person making the journey would be required to go to a ticket machine to obtain the fourth ticket. This was not suitable as I purchased the ticket for my partner so firstly, she would not have my bank card (required at the machine) nor would she be able to use the machine hence my payment to have the tickets delivered. If I wanted to or was able to use the ticket machine I would have done so for all the tickets. Escalated the call to Virgin Trains and was told a supervisor would call back within 24 hours, no one called. Second time was informed someone would call back within 72 hours, no one called. My only alternative was to obtain the missing ticket from another train company so now I have paid twice for the same journey. Less than happy with this awful service from Virgin Trains.\",\"We were due to return from a short break in Edinburgh on Thursday 1st March but due to the weather this was not possible which we totally understand. However, what followed is unbelievable in the 21st century. We eventually managed to get a train back on Monday 5th March as they had been cancelled until then with no alternative offered other than a refund of our ticket.Trying to contact Virgin is impossible and have to rely on social media for regular updates. We have emailed several times but just get the automated response and here we are 7th March and still heard nothing. We are out of pocket by almost \\u00a3300 for further hotel costs plus the cost of meals etc. We were obviously not the only ones as lucky to keep our room.

But do not be fooled by what they claim on their website. I have had to call them 3 times and they every time I have called them in intervals of a week I was told that they do not know why it's not processed and they will have to initiate it again. It seems as if they want to delay this process on purpose or they do not want to pay you back your own money altogether. I cant trust the words written on their website or the words spoken by the customer services team over the phone.\",\"I haven't reviewed very much before and do not leave companies bad reviews. But our experience of trying to get a refund for a train that was cancelled due to the snow is appalling.\",\"The Virgin Trains sales-person at Euston Station was rude and ignorant.\",\"Rude staff at Moor Street when trying to reclaim tickets when I lost my travel pass - got told that it was the ticket issuers (West Midlands Railway), not the pass issuers (Chiltern), even though the Network West Midlands site says that the pass holder is liable.\",\"This train company is the worst, the trains always run late never on time!

Exactly like previous reviews.\",\"A very bad experience with Virgin staff who were less than helpful. After waiting 2 hours in the freezing cold station at Glasgow where actual snow flakes were coming through the roof our train back to London Euston flashed up cancelled. I asked the Virgin staff what should we do and the only advice given by a truly fed up female member of their staff was to download their train app and twitter for live updates. When asked but we are now stranded the female shrugged her shoulders put her arms out and said frostily \\\"nothing I can do\\\"! We were \\\"abandoned\\\" for 4 days without an offer of them finding accommodation, food or drink.....yet they had a duty of care which they failed dismally to provide. Their tweets advised each day that trains would leave Glasgow yet when you looked on Euston they were ALL cancelled and I had to tweet them to say their live updates were in fact incorrect. We discovered by mere chance they were starting to bus passengers from Glasgow to Carlisle where trains were now running ....this information was on Teletext but not Twitter! So the following morning (day 4 of being abandoned) we drudged our way down to the station in the snow at 7.00am without breakfast or a hot drink. We expected a notice to advise passengers we expected a member of Virgin staff to be on hand but there was no one! I had to ask the ticket sales manager who advised connection buses were laid on yesterday but Virgin staff didn't want to make it public as they would be unindated instead it was by mere chance if passengers found out.....shocking! This was infuriating to say the least as we could have got home a day early saving the added expense of a night's accommodation, food, drink not to mention our 2 dogs who had been stuck in kennels. The bus turned up shortly after 8am and we were ushered on to it. No provision of hot drinks or food which could have been provided by Virgin as nearby food outlets were open. We travelled to Carlisle station where on the platform there were a handful of Virgin staff in a huddle keeping their distance from the passengers. We had to approach them for advice. We purchased our own drinks + food from the nearby kiosk but again no offer from Virgin despite their passenger charter of providing refreshment and food where possible....well it was possible! On the train to Preston the buffet car was shut due to passengers sitting on the floor....the train was rammed. We had to change at Preston to catch another train to Milton Keynes. And it wasn't until we had just left Birmingham that food was finally provided.....unfortunately no hot drinks as the boiler had broken! It has taken 55 days to get a reply to my complaint and to be reimbursed for accommodation only apparently on this occasion they are not reimbursing food and drink....How do they expect us to be stuck with a bill out of our control whilst in their care?! I might add I had to chase the reply up on numerous occasions .....online chats as Virgin obviously don't have human beings that can talk on a phone! Managers were apparently always in meetings leaving their staff to front the online chats and some not very successfully either. I was constantly being promised a reply with 10 working days....5 working days....by the end of the week.....oh you will receive it by next Wednesday as our printer for the cheques has broken! Fobbed off big time and to think a big company like Virgin only have \\\"one\\\" printer to print the cheques....yeah right! The letter was a standard reply which lacked empathy or sincerity for any remorse regarding our stranded situation. They barely apologised. So why did it take 55 days to reply? Their website states 28 days which again they clearly failed like their trains. Would I recommend Virgin trains \\\"No\\\"!\",\"I sent an email to the customer service department on the 23/3 to ask how to reserve a train seat on my return journey from London on the 11/4 while travelling for a month through Europe.

I received no information or help from the company.\",\"Had the misfortune to travel 3 times with this company and every time I have been let down. Most recent was travelling to Liverpool Lime Street from Shrewsbury with a change at Crewe. Unbeknown to myself Liverpool were playing Roma at Anfield on the day I travelled and being disabled I am unable to stand for any length of time despite the fact that a seat had been reserved but was unable to use it. Virgin train dispatchers are rude and insensitive to people with mobility issues, the final straw being oh well if you had arranged assistance in advance we could have helped you. Having done this on previous travels with this company where assistance was conspicuous by it s absence or so grudging that you feel as though you are a nuisance. Sadly, I'm due to travel to Blackpool to a conference in a weeks time and guess which train company I've got to make do with, yes Virgin again.\",\"E-mail sent to Mr Branson and Co\",\"After cancelling my train and the one that was supposed to be an alternative  train I was told by a virgin employee when I complained if you don't like it don't go by train\",\"getting better!\",\"Regrettably I use Virgin trains a lot for work, commuting from Kings Cross to various parts of the country.

I didn't have enough money for anywhere to stay overnight or to get a train ticket in the morning from Glasgow... however I was delighted to find out that the extremely helpful lady, the train manager, had pulled a few strings, made a few calls and arranged for train to stop at an earlier station AND for a train going the other way to make an impromptu stop at the station for me the switch trains and provided me with a FREE customer service ticket as the means for my transport the following morning... although the train wasn't going all the way to my destination due to the time of day, the train stopped at Preston where the members on the platform reassured me for my transport the next day which was faultless as well... was my first time I used the service last November and I will always appreciate the great act of kindness by the Virgin trains workers...

I rang the telephone number on their site to explain what had happened all I got was a very rude man who could hardly understand what I was saying and refused to help, let me speak to a supervisor or give me another number to call!!  I am waiting for feedback from an online complaint so their rating may improve if I get better help but the advisor was awful and so rude.  I am quite annoyed that I never had these issues with east coast before virgin took over but they need a massive improvement in helping their customers!!

My company pays thousands. I am really dissapionted that my company pays \\u00a3181 for a trip to London yet I always find the seats are not clean. Often dust and food left rotting by other customers isn't cleaned up for my journey. I would not pay this much to travel as it's very uncomfortable to sit on a seat that is clearly dirty. I have experienced this many times now. My most frequent route is Birmingham to London.\",\"I recently contacted customer services and the reply was curt, unhelpful did not answer the points I raised.

In 2014 my experiences were very poor. This year I only needed to take one trip, from Carlisle to London, and was very disappointed to find if anything a deterioration. I booked first class as I normally do, and it was nearly 100 pounds for this three hour trip. It is daylight robbery, really. But if the service had been good I would not have complained. I boarded at about 9.50am and was hoping for some mid-morning coffee and cakes but half an hour or so later, they came round with breakfast (bacon sandwich and fruit).  Why anyone would want breakfast at 10.30 am is beyond me. I asked for a biscuit or something and all they could give me was a croissant. While making a decision about breakfast I asked what time lunch would be. I was told 'after Preston' which told me nothing, really, but seemed odd as the train was due to arrive at Preston at about 11am which was very soon afterwards! (Actually it was about an hour after Preston that lunch came round (what was fine), and I since realised that 'after Preston' meant that there was  a new shift of staff and the current staff could not give a flying fig what happened to customers aftrer they themselves left the train).\",\"Booking made a month prior to travel, sent in rail vouchers to pay for part of my journey but these somehow became lost in the post. Called to pay for the rest of my journey, passed to many different departments. Repeatedly told incorrect information. Promised numerous call backs but recieved none. Told that the 'back office' needed to take payment as no other department had the facilities to do this. But I could never seem to get through to them. A day before travel and its still not sorted out, extremely stressful and totally incompetant and unhelpful organisation.\",\"I booked in March for a journey in August and decided to go for the first class option - \\u00a331 each way with a senior railcard.  We travelled to Edinburgh at 3.30 pm and came back on a 7.30 am train.  The food and drink options were very good with no shortage of things to eat and drink - lots of alcohol available on the evening journey.  The staff were well presented and very competent.  The seats were very comfortable for a long trip.  All in all there were no complaints and I would most certainly use this service again.\",\"Virgin, like certain airlines, have no interest in the customer. Whatever our complaint, they always seek to justify, never correct.

My daughter was booked into 1st Class on the 18:41 from Edinburgh to Newcastle. I appreciate the weather was extreme and the situation rapidly spiraled out of control. We checked your website for updates as we were well aware of flooding etc in the Borders & Northumberland. Your Website indicated a detour via Carlisle which although was reassuring we thought a bit odd, due to flooding in Cumbria?! We stood with hundreds of other anxious passengers on the main Waverley concourse tracking the 18:41 train as it moved towards its departure time. All it showed was 'On Time' but no platform? As the minutes ticked by and arrival time ticked on, we realized with no updates or reliable information the 18:41 was either cancelled or going no where fast, for obvious reasons. Trying to make sense of PA announcements in that crowd was impossible. We could only see 'Scotrail'Staff reassuring their passengers but where were Virgin Staff, conspicuous by their absence?! The Waverley Information counter was 80 + persons deep. Your website was not updating, I tried Twitter and received supercilious, snarky Tweets from yourselves which did nothing to reassure us. Eventually a woman in a Virgin windbreaker casually informed us that Buses / Coaches were waiting on the Market Street side of Waverley, this triggered a mad scramble up escalators & stairs: (the elderly, infirm & blind took their chances) and as we arrived at the Market Street exit, a bemused BR Policeman informed us there were no Buses / Coaches! Still no Virgin staff to advise or re-assure. Another mad scramble back to the Virgin Ticket Office which was bursting to the rafters. 2 maybe 3 staff trying to advise us, your Passengers. Again no announcements, no staff coming out to speak etc. Hundreds in the queue.  By 19:12:40 (can supply a photo) the 18:41 train was still on the Board as 'Delayed' No it wasn't, it was 'Cancelled' but still no word from Virgin, just hundreds of your passengers trying to glean information and separate the rumors from fact. It became apparent that the single man (can supply a photo) in your Virgin Ticket Office, who despite over whelming odds, was dolling out Taxi Vouchers, to get folk home to Newcastle. Eventually I got my daughter into a party of 4 other ladies all bound for Newcastle, eventually leaving on a highly hazardous road journey to Newcastle Central. I repeat - I fully understand that the weather played havoc with Train departures. I fully appreciate it had been raining for 2 days none stop. I do not appreciate the lack of reliable, reassuring information from Virgin Rail. You have glossy, glitzy and funky PR and TV ads, but when the wet & brown smelly stuff hits the fan, your staff, such as those I could see, had not a clue how to deal with agitated & anxious passengers stranded in Waverley. Shame on you Virgin Rail! Your planning & protocols are abysmal!\",\"I booked a ticket online ticking the reserve seat option. After payment taken received confirmation but no reserved seats.  Contacted via Facebook who said booking was not available on my selected journey and advised to make a complaint via customer service.  Did so,  did not receive a response. Contacted virgin by Facebook again who said they needed more time to respond. I reminded them my journey was in the morning. Distinct lack of concern or apology in their next reply. A report to trading standards is being made as I was simply mis-sold the ticket and service.\",\"I tend to find that staff on Virgin trains are rude towards passengers waiting in the hallways of first class carriages. They are also very judgmental at classifying people without even asking for their tickets. So, if you don't look like an MP or a businessman then I am afraid you are out.

I didn't realise my name would be on the ticket (or that I would be the one who had to be on the train in the first place), paid to buy my friend a ticket and then found out that it wouldn't count.

A woman standing in the corridor by the toilet -- she was with her two adult kids, who were sitting on the floor, and small grandchild in a stroller shoved up against the exit door -- said the overcrowding isn't unusual on Virgin trains, and that the first-class section had plenty of seats available but the authorities won't let second-class passengers move up there even when the situation was this bad and dangerous - people and their belongings jammed in to fill ALL the floor space, including by the toilets, to the point it was impossible to walk through.

The train operatives commenced serving food.  They stopped at the seat in from of us.  The operative apologised and said he was off to replenish his trolley. Unfortunately when his trolley was replenished he commenced serving from the rear of our carriage and ran out AGAIN when he reached us.   I would also point out that we appeared to be the only 2 people travelling together.  He apologised profusely and he and a female colleague went in search of our meal. Sadly to no avail.  We were then offered something from the on board cafe. We went to look at the menu and we're disappointed to see bread, bread, bread, wraps and again bread !!!!! Exactly what we wanted to avoid.  Full marks to the operative he tried to reassure us that the food from the cafe cost Eurostar much more than the salmon we might have had. He did try to lighten the load but bottles of wine where not what we wanted or expected. Eurostar you need to up your game.

They dont even tell where you are in the Que to give you any indication you are actually moving nearer to speaking to someone.

My daughter was stuck on one of their trains very late at night for two hours in almost total darkness as there was no power. We sent in the ticket and all details to claim the full refund for the fare as they say you are entitled to after an hours delay. The reply by email was she is not entitled to a refund because the train was only delayed for 1 minute. You cant reply to the email and they state you have to ring them if you have any further questions. But strangely enough no one answers the phone. This company must be making an absolute fortune from not giving customers back there refunds when they are entitled and people just give up trying due to such terrible customer service. It is disgraceful how they are allowed to carry on like this they dont deserve there licence as a transport company.We are also waiting for two more refunds for tickets that had to be changed but where re-booked on a different day, but no refund has ever emerged for these journeys and its been over a month now.

After failing to move the other two customers who had boarded incorrectly we were asked to move which wouldn\\u2019t have been a problem however we were expected to be split up which we weren\\u2019t prepared to do and after having to stand for the first half an hour of our journey and being spoken to rudely by staff including being sworn at it was discovered there was two seats together all along... As well as the terrible journey Euro star failed to respond in a satisfactory manor after the events not responding for two weeks after my initial complaint and then once I finally received a reply it was a very unconvincing acknowledgment of the events and that they will look into them. Since this I haven\\u2019t heard from Euro star at all and I would not recommend anyone to use this service due to their complete lack of customer service both on the train and via their complaints department.\",\"Train stalled made us 2 hours late and miss our last connection home. Had to get home via taxi. Conducter was very unhelpful on train and gave no info on what to do after the\",\"Travelled on Friday 20th from St Pancras to Lille and was not impressed by rudeness of Security staff. I was wearing a new jacket which at the last minute I was told to remove and the staff took it and laid it carelessly on top of my luggage. It  ended up shredded  in the conveyor and covered in oil. Had it not been for my husband speaking fluent French we wouldn't have had anyone to help us. Eventually we were taken aside and it took so long to find a form we nearly missed the train.The staff were so rude as if we were about to be charged for something. Not necessary at all ! The form I was given had the wrong email address for contact and I have spent all morning trying to find the correct email. To add insult to injury we were given incorrect info regarding the strike and we had to rebook our seats to get a seat four hours later.We spent \\u00a340 on a taxi to Lille Station to get accurate info  as on line details were contradictory. Not impressed at all .In Lille's favour the staff were far more obliging ! Our on going connections from Euston were totally messed up and the day ended splendidly 12 hours later with trains still out of action on the route to Blackpool. Cest.la vie....plus ca change !\",\"As a regular First Class traveller with this train company, I am totally brassed off with how they're allowed to get away with charging First Class ticket prices whilst not providing First Class service. For example, I travelled from Leicester to Derby last night (27 Apr 18) on the 22.03 service. It was announced at Leicester station there would be an at-seat service on the train but did I see one? Of course not! There were five female members of the on-train team stood in the area at the back of Coach G laughing and joking for the entirety of my journey and none of them attempted to serve refreshments in First Class or even check tickets.\",\"Just want to say a huge Thank You to Ian Thomas of Arriva Trains, Holyhead, Wales. I lost my Interrail ticket while changing trains and he went to great lengths to get it back for me - he first rang around all the trains and stations it could have been at and then when it was luckily found, he organized to have it brought to Holyhead for me a couple of hours later so I was able to seamlessly continue on my journey to Dublin. Amazing customer service!\",\"Still waiting for a refund for a January journey I had to change. I rebooked and paid again on their instructions and applied for a refund for the unused journey.

19.00 train to Manchester, the 27th of February. Ok it is a Friday, it is busy and we know it. The train is a chaotic mess of people sitting on the floor, while the bar conveniently had \\\"problems\\\" with the card machines. In fact we read problems as a very well known fault in the train infrastructure that makes credit card payments a pain everyday. So ok, we do not want to have queues of people standing waiting for signal, so we tolerate. Then the train manager starts with the usual litany of scripted apologies and he is so moving when he profers \\\"I applogise because no one should be sitting on a floor during a travel.\\\" Thanks for beating your chest boy, however your first class is empty and when we booked the ticket no message would tell us that the train was overcrowded and there was no seat available. A word of advice, do not take your Customers for cretins while you play your yeld management the dirty way.\",\"I try to get up to Scotland maybe once a month as it's home and I was hoping to take my dog north with me this weekend but booked without checking that they'd charge \\u00a394 for her to travel with me.\",\"I recently had reason to call web support to get advice on a ticket query, after thirty plus minutes of holding I gave up and tried again a few hours later, same result, over an hour wasted in two calls and still no answer. It wasn't like this before Virgin took over so what's changed? Get your act together Virgin, just because you have a monopoly doesn't mean you can take the mickey.\",\"I was travelling yesterday (28th December 2015) from Peterborough to Edinburgh on a Virgin Train, and upon boarding the train was told by the conductor (over the public intercom) that [electronic] seat reservation systems where not in place due to an unspecified issue at the Kings Cross Terminal (which the train was from).\",\"After reading previous comment I cannot agree more with what's being said. Train manager on the 10:50am service from Birmingham was a disgrace. All they think about is revenue. There is no customer service.\",\"I got a train headed to Peterborough from London, the conductor came up to the bathroom banging on the door when I was in there for less than a minute claiming I was taking too long, I had explained to her I missed my train by a few minutes so came into this one and was told it would be okay for me to travel by a staff member at kings cross, she demanded I pay \\u00a333.20 on the spot for a ticket even though I showed her my reservation for the tickets online. with less than 20 minutes left of my journey, due to having severe anxiety people began to stare at me so I couldn't say anything and willingly paid the money. for a one hour journey in a cramped carriage with rude staff is something I will not be paying \\u00a360 for, Virgin trains you are an awful company and I will not be travelling with you again!\",\"Am not normally the sort of person that writes a review but having had so many bad experiences on Virgin east coast trains it seemed reasonable to do so. Every single train journey I have had the misfortune to endure has either been delayed by such a considerable amount that it has been valid for a refund or some kind of transport alternative or it's been so full that even standing has been impossible in standard(cattle) class. To add insult to injury, the staff are often very rude and unreasonable. Today, I saw a pregnant lady turned away from sitting in first class because she'd booked a standard class ticket. Fair enough, maybe but not when standard class is so full that she couldn't even get through to the seat she'd booked. Having experienced this journey with so many different train operators I feel Virgin east coast has brought any journey north of London to an all time low\",\"Took a train from Glasgow to Preston.  I was surprised to discover that unlike on ScotRail trains, wifi is not free. Purchased a \\u00a310 flexible wifi access code and then used most of it trying to connect to a service that dropped repeatedly and was unbelievably slow.  If you are going to charge people for wifi access then you must provide a reasonable level of service!\",\"I have used your Eurostar service from London to Paris on Friday July 8th at 14:01. This service was heavily delayed by one hour. This caused me a lot of problems and in the end was unable to enjoy my trip due to the lateness of my arrival.\",\"These virgin trains are jokes you reserve seats for 2 adults and a child but children get on free so you dont get a seat for them!! So now us and my 4 year old are sitting in between carriages for a 3 hour journey and the staff are no help atall. WHY DONT THE KIDS GET A TICKET SO THEY HAVE A SEAT!!\",\"After cashing in nectar points to use towards virgin trains, I booked a month in advance. Got booking confirmation all seemed good. 3 days before due to travel still no tickets, so rang to enquire. After talking to 5 or 6 different CSA, non seemed to know where my tickets were, I didn't have a booking or I was phoning the wrong company?! Promises to ring me back never came to fruition and I eventually booked again. Same seats cheaper price. To turn up at the station to find train cancelled and next delayed. So couldn't have the seats I booked and was late.Fantastic start to our holiday with a three year old! Disgusting and I will never use again. 6 hours of phone calls, 2 days of panic in case we couldn't met our flight and miserable experience.

On their website they clearly state that they will refund if the train is late for half an hour , even when we board the train, the caption announce there will be refund. We wait for the refund to be back to my sis account. No news ! Make a complaint online, no reply. Call them and it take forever for them to take the call. Finally when they take the call said the case not open yet. And we wrote email again. 2 weeks later, call again to check the status said it takes 2 weeks to process the claim. Well, we call them only after two weeks and still the same answer. Call them today and get the reply that we should write email to another email address. For one month, no action was taken! If you don't want to refund why on earth would you guarantee it online. Feel like getting cheated. Really have a bad feeling about this virgin train.\",\"train from york to london has been all cancelled and after faffing around, one of the member of staff told me to go to this platform and the train will head straight to london king's cross. turns out it was heading to thirsk and i had to take the train from there back to york to get another train to london again. absolute nightmare.\",\"My train leaving Paris at 19:01 was cancelled because of problems in the Channel tunnel. When I arrived at Gare du Nord, the Eurostar area was closed off and very little information available. After 10 or 15 minutes, a woman came out and told us there were no more trains that day and they had no ability to help us at the station. She asked us to leave the station and use the website to rebook.\",\"Took over one month to receive response to complaint about on board staff member who was aggressive and rude to me and my husband.

However Virgin customer services have decided to ignore that promise. I have also involved London travel watch who have apealed to Virgin on my behalf without success. London Travel watch have told me that they are very disappointed with Virgin trains attitude over this matter.\",\"First class used to be nice!! Nice hot meals have been replaced by \\\"a gourmet sausage roll with gourmet chutney\\\"!! If you've just paid out for a first class ticket do you really want a sausage roll?!? There used to be nice cakes when it was East Coast! They've disappeared!! The nice sandwiches have been replaced by dodgy bacon sarnies and a houmous wrap where the houmous layer was so thin that they seem to have made a scientific breakthrough by splitting the houmous atom!! Used to get a cup of tea - now that gets offered to me 10 seconds before we roll into Peterborough and I don't ever really feel like a tea shot \\\"down in one\\\"!!\",\"After 6 months we have still not received delay compensation. Initially filled in their online claim form. Waited 3 months no sign of any compensation. Wrote to them and was bounced around a bit until I was asked to resubmit details of journey again. After waiting again for over a month contacted them again and pointed out that they had already received their payment from Network Rail for the delay so where was mine. Waited again and then asked what train I was on. Fortunately I still had the seat reservation sent that off and reminded them that the whole trip was booked via their web site so they should have a record anyway. Usual reply \\\"wait ten working days \\\". It doesn't take 6 months to buy a ticket so why should we have to wait 6 months for compensation. From my contact with them it would appear that they are not interested in customer service. Disgraceful.\",\"Trains are way too expensive! Tickets from Birmingham to London are so expensive (around \\u00a3200) that if I would have to go there for any reason would have to work nearly a month at my part time job so that I could earn enough of money for a one way ticket. Never seen more expensive train tickets in my life. Absolutely not worth it. Even plain tickets are cheaper, I would advise you to reconsider the train ticket price as it disturbs people from living and moving around freely.\",\"Booked a trip from London - Edinburgh for my 70 year old parents who had flown in from Australia the day before, me and my husband, and our 2 kids under 10.

I have taken to travelling and couple of hours before any major meetings as I have been delayed so many times. But this week was even worse. I was told my ticket was invalid on the London to York service I was on - even though I had been told otherwise - and the 'revenue protection officer' tried to make me pay an extra \\u00a3129. After the unhelpful guard had told me which train my ticket was valid on (including that same train after Peterborough - but I couldn't stay on it as I hadn't joined it there?!) I was told by the guard on the next train that my ticket wasn't valid on that service either! Anyway, I eventually got home much later than planned, and it had to involve a \\u00a330 taxi ride home as I missed the last train. Awful treatment by Virgin. I had been representing the UK in Brussels and chose to get the train. Next time I'll fly.\",\"Website wouldn't let me book trian combination wanted, even though it was two singles.

A freight train broke down in front of us which added a huge delay to the journey. Virgin staff were extremely helpful and ensured we stretched our legs on the platform we were thankfully sat at during the issues, brought us complimentary snacks and also kept us updated with as much info as they could provide. Upon arrival in Euston I was very worried as all tubes had finished for the evening as it was almost 3am but once I left the train staff were on hand to guide all customers to free taxis. Although the delay was a massive hassle, which was clearly out of Virgins control, the staff made up for this as much as possible.\",\"On the 1900 from Kings X to Edinburgh yesterday, coach D had no air conditioning, and overheated quite badly. The train was full in standard class, so the train manager made an announcement that there were empty seats in first class, and anyone suffering from the heat  was welcome to move. They just had to buy a first class ticket!\",\"Such a lovely company. Me and my boyfriend are both only 15 and went down to London on the train and my mum and family went down in cars (as I was a bridesmaid so went down earlier). Mix up with bags as my mum left earlier than we had do catch our train and forgot my purse with the tickets were still in her bag! After being messed around at London Euston station, after having both my mum and my brother speak to several members of staff they were basically willing to leave two 15 year olds at London station -on our own- until they could get to a station and fax the tickets over! Which may of been a while as they were on the motorway home already. Our train was due to set off in 5 minutes, we were so worried we weren't going to make it home we went down to the train and I spoke to a man who works for virgin trains, he was so lovely and understanding and he re assured me and my mum, who were both frantically panicking, that he would ensure we got on and got home safe and he would speak to the people on the train for us and just for her to meet us when we got off to show the tickets then\\ud83d\\ude0c So happy this man was so kind and understanding after the half an hour of panic and arguing to try and get us home and not left there on our own.

They don't care about compensating . All they say is \\\"sorry\\\" a million times in the announcement which makes your ears go deaf.

Granted, I decided to travel Standard Premier from London to Brussels and a week later from Paris back to London. Both were very good but the last journey on 14 October was outstanding. The comfort, food and the staff were very impressive and I hope that they have finally started to get their act together. The terminal in Paris has improved but still does not compare with St Pancras. I just question why they do not give passengers more time to board at the ST Pancras end.

Useless website, inundated with utterly pointless links and no actual helpful information. Weekend trains take a hour longer with no explanation why. Can't reserve a seat modification if you make it that far on the booking process. Trains are always under-stocked and delayed.

It was like getting a trolley full of food at a supermarket only to be told at the checkout that they are raising all the prices of the food in your trolley because you took the last items off the shelf.  Sharp practice and very poor.

Will never travel with Virgin again if I can help it. I now discover amongst friends online that they won't travel in this country because it involves using a Virgin train.

During the snow disruption I travelled from Preston to Carlisle with them. The train was announced and shown on the board as going to Glasgow, but as soon as the doors were closed they announced it would be terminating at Carlisle because of the snow situation further north. There were people who would not have got on that train if they had been told this originally. They were all simply dumped at Carlisle and told that they'd have to wait there until the line re-opened (which was being measured in days rather than hours), or go back towards London. There were no more hotel rooms available in Carlisle, which is quite a small town. I was travelling across the country to Newcastle so I was not directly affected, but I felt so desperately sorry for all these poor stranded people. I sat next to a quite elderly  lady who had joined the train to Carlisle because she had been told by Virgin staff it was going on to Glasgow and was now having to travel to Newcastle just to find a hotel room. There is no way that Virgin central command, wherever that is, did not already know that the line to Glasgow was blocked, but their customer service is so routinely appalling that they didn't feel it necessary to share accurate information with the public, let alone make any attempt to help people who were stranded. From now on I am only travelling with Transpennine. And there is no way I would ever buy any other product from the Virgin empire, because the sight of their logo just makes me feel sick.\",\"Virgin trains - instead of wasting money on stupid annoying voice messages in toilets trying to be funny when not; invest the money in something new like cleaning them?
